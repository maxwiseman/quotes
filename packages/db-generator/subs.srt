00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,179
Hello and welcome
to a Top Gear special.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,599
You join us in Downing Street
for a very good reason.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,279
You see, shortly after coming
into power, Mr Cameron

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,879
noticed that Britain was,
in essence, bankrupt,

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,719
and that to solve the problem

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,559
we needed to do
more business with India.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,159
He has a point, because it turns out
we sell more to Ireland,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,199
that has a population of 4.5 million
than we do to India,

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,679
that has a population
of 1,000 million.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,799
It's actually even worse
than that.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,599
It turns out that we sell even less
to India than the Belgians do.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,639
So, we contacted Downing Street
and offered to go over to India

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,639
and run a trade mission
on the nation's behalf.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,439
I have here a personal letter reply
to us from David Cameron himself.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,879
"Dear Top Gear,
thank you for your letter.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,039
"Whilst it's true I'm keen on us
to build on our ties out there,

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,159
"sending you three is not quite
what I had in mind.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,120
"The Foreign Secretary
did wonder instead

20
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,079
about a fencemending
trip to Mexico."

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,479
"Basically, my message is this..."

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,919
"you do the cars,
we'll do the diplomacy."

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
Oh, here he comes now.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,760
Stay away from India.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,679
Well, that was unequivocal.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,399
Well, we're going to ignore
the Prime Minister.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,599
What we're going to do instead is
to buy three second-hand British

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,959
cars, and then to head over there
with a very simple objective...

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,120
to rescue Britain.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,799
'The start point
for our trade mission was Bombay.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,279
CAR HORNS BLARE

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
'A vibrant, teeming mass
of 20 million potential customers.'

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,759
I am the first to arrive,
and as you possibly wouldn't expect

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,479
I don't appear to have
done this quite right.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,399
This is a Series-1 Rolls-Royce
Silver Shadow from 1976.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,599
Some of you will be saying, "You should
have brought a modern Rolls-Royce."

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,199
There's two reasons why I couldn't...

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,719
firstly, I had a budget
of just Ã£7,000.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,679
Secondly, a modern Rolls-Royce
is of course a German car,

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,599
whereas this one was hand-wrought
in Crewe in a factory that used

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,559
to make Merlin engines
for Spitfires out of the finest

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,599
'At this point Jeremy arrived... '
Behold.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,479
'..in easily the most inappropriate
car it is possible to imagine.'

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,999
You stupid man.
What's wrong with it?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,639
We're here representing Britain,
and all that's great about Britain,

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,239
and you have brought along
a Jaguar XJS,

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,999
almost certainly our country's
most historically unreliable car.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,639
This is the celebration model.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,999
Is it a celebration of production
finally coming to end?

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,919
60 years of Jaguar.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
Special wheels,
special colour-coordinated bumpers,

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,359
four-litre, straight six engine.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
That thing has a reputation
for stopping.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,880
James, as I recall
the braking system

55
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,079
and steering is controlled
by hydraulics. That is right.

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,439
Now, if this car were to break
down in the Rolls-Royce factory,

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,159
next to the team that built it,
they wouldn't be able to mend it.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,999
You're in India. Yes. If your
hydraulics go wrong, you are out.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,920
You are an embarrassment
to the nation.

60
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:51,159
And can I just say, this vinyl roof,

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,399
he's just put the final
over the guttering.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,519
This is not an advertisement.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,519
If you were advertising
Millets' tenting...

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,599
This car helped cement the very
special Anglo-Indian relationship.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,519
How? The favoured car
of the maharajas.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,919
They sold hundreds of cars to India.
Only because Jaguar wasn't around.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,799
All of the maharajas would have had
XJSs. They wouldn't. They would!

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,959
'At this point, something
very small arrived... ' Ha ha!

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,760
'..in a Mini!'

70
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,359
Oh, God, that's an absolute beauty.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,239
That's quite a good idea, actually,
but don't tell him.

72
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,599
Hammond, you idiot. You idiot.
What?! Is that a good idea, is it?

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,359
Is it a good idea? It's genius.

74
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,879
Just to clarify what this is,
it's a classic Mini Cooper Sport.

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,680
One of the very last ones
built, in fact.

76
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,719
Year 2000. That is immaculate.

77
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,879
That is pretty tidy. It really is.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,879
This is India, though.
It's a big old place,

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,319
and this is a small old car.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,079
Come on, lads, you both know it is
the home of the small car. Was.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,079
No, it still is. What matters most
in India is how big it is inside,

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,519
how small it is outside, and how many
people it carries. That's racist.

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,239
What?! When India was emerging,

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,679
they saw the car as a tool,

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,839
but now that India HAS emerged,

86
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,119
and is one
of the economic superpowers,

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,839
everybody is going to want something
with a great, long thrusting...

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,319
No, what happens next
is the country grows out

89
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,639
of the great, long thrusting,
and they come back to wanting,

90
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,999
yes, style, and practicality,
and convenience...? Look at it!

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,119
Yes, but we are trying to say
that Britain is a great country,

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,279
and has things to offer
to a country which has succeeded.

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,439
Such as this... No! ..not a tired old
Jaguar, and that's a Shadow? It is.

94
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,879
How far do you think
he's going to get in that?

95
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,959
Well, I think he's probably finished,
isn't he? That's it.

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,199
Let's see. 'Hammond and May
then ganged up on my Jag.'

97
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,199
I should point out the bits that
will go wrong. Yes. All of those.

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah. See all of those
relays and those connectors?

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,639
Made in the Midlands, they will go
wrong. Cooling system will go wrong.

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,960
It's OK, some of the relays
are made in Spain.

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,199
'We'd find out soon enough
if we'd made the right choices,

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,159
'because ahead lay
a 1,300-mile journey

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,999
'on some of the most dangerous
roads in the world.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,560
'And then up into the brutal
high passes of the Himalayas.

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,279
'But first,
we had to get to know our cars

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,519
'on the streets of Bombay.'

107
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,999
HE GIGGLES This is the
perfect car for this place!

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,439
It is a puppy, yes, but it's
a Staffordshire bull terrier.

109
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,399
It is a... (MAKES BARKING NOISE)
A tough little puppy.

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,519
I've forgotten the way
these things deliver their power,

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,559
it's such a chunky little engine.

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,280
Oow! Yeah, speed humps,
how I miss you(!)

113
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,320
A man taking his washing machine
for a walk!

114
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Morning.

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,119
Whenever we do these
long journeys on Top Gear,

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,799
there's always a sense,
the moment I set off,

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
that the car is already on its last
legs, but in this, there isn't.

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,079
All the dials are reading
what they should be reading,

119
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,840
the engine is smooth, the gear-change
is smooth, all the electrics work.

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,399
This is a mobile advertisement
for Great Britain.

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,919
Never mind that Jag today is Indian,
let's gloss over that.

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,759
HORN BLARES

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,759
210 horsepower... what Rolls...Royce
would have called "adequate."

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,959
It is adequate, more than adequate.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,319
BUZZER SOUNDS

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,679
That's a buzzer that will sound
if it overheats, say,

127
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,959
or the hydraulic brakes fail. Let's
check that it works. You see?

128
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
BUZZER SOUNDS

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,399
I love India,
I love the dynamism of it all.

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,199
People are busy. Business, business,
business. Get on, get rich.

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,360
Jag!

132
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,999
Look at that! Hammond's Mini.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
He is a man in love!

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,439
MAKES GRUNTING NOISES
AT GEAR CHANGES

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,759
Weirdly, I have never
actually owned a Mini.

136
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,519
My brother had one, my best friend
had one, my girlfriend had one,

137
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,159
which I blew up
while she was on holiday.

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,959
I changed the engine in it,

139
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,759
and I bought one for 25 quid
and fitted it over a weekend

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,159
and never told her.

141
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,039
Until just then, when I told her,
then. Sorry about your car...

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
Mel.

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,199
I know Hammond hasn't got it,
so it's pointless asking,

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,919
but is your conditioning working?

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,199
Er, not as such. No.

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,319
'No, neither is mine.'

147
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,759
I thought it was,
for a brief, glorious moment,

148
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,600
but then I realised, no, it isn't.

149
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,879
What I was saying then
about my air conditioning

150
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
isn't actually true,
it's working an absolute treat,

151
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,599
but I don't want to tell them that
because they will just try

152
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,159
and break it in the night, because
they're resentful and peevish.

153
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,919
Guys, you know the producers
always provide a backup car

154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,919
'on these shoots, in case
one of our cars go wrong?'

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,079
Yes.

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,319
'Have you seen what's coming
up in the middle lane

157
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
'on British plates right now?'

158
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,039
I've just seen it. I think
I've seen it, is it an Allegro?

159
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,679
It is.

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,639
Oh, you're joking!

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,479
'Spurred on by this
terrible development,

162
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,719
'we decided to begin
our vital trade mission,

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,800
'starting with one of Bombay's
most famous institutions.'

164
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,559
Everyday an army of about
5,000 people called dabbawalas

165
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,879
travel around the outskirts
of the city

166
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,279
collecting lunches in tins,
like these ones here.

167
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,279
They've been made by the wives
of working men, and from here

168
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,159
they are transported on foot,

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,640
or by bicycle
to the nearest train station.

170
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,319
Each tin is marked
with a system of symbols

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,319
that tells the dabbawalas
on the train where it's going.

172
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,200
So they know which tins have to be
unloaded at which station.

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,399
The tins are then picked up
at city centre stations

174
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,079
by yet more dabbawalas,

175
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,399
who bring them to the menfolk
in their offices.

176
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,479
And the cost of having a piping hot,

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,200
home-cooked lunch, delivered
every day, is Ã£2 a month.

178
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,279
'What makes the whole system
really incredible

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,279
'is that 200,000 lunches
are delivered every day.

180
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,399
'Even though there's no FedEx-style
computerised tracking system,

181
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,319
'only one mistake is made
for every six million deliveries.

182
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,280
'That works out at an accuracy
level of 99.9996%.'

183
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,599
I think, however,
we could do better.

184
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,559
How can we do better than that?! If
you think about it, they use trains,

185
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,879
what if we used our cars?
That's not a bad idea, actually.

186
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,199
The first dabbawalas bring it to the
car park at the railway station.

187
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,839
Instead of putting it on the
train, we'll take it in our cars.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,559
We'll beat the train.

189
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,600
If you think, when
you're at home and you

190
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,639
order a takeout pizza,
do they use the train?

191
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,039
They use a moped or a car. They are
hamstrung by tradition. They are.

192
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,799
"For 120 years, we've always used
to train. We always use the train."

193
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
This is where we can help.
Then it will be

194
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,599
remembered the day the
dabbawala system was updated,

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,719
it was in a British car.
Exactly! Three British cars.

196
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
We're about to plug that gap.

197
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,720
That 0.0004% gap.

198
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,359
'And, so, the next day
our experiment began.

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,079
'We would load the meals
into our cars at Andheri station,

200
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,719
'in the suburbs, and then race
the train-bound dabbawalas

201
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,640
'to the finish line at Churchgate
station in the city centre.'

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,399
'Our train rivals prepared for
the challenge with quiet efficiency

203
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,360
'whereas in the car park,
things were rather less calm.'

204
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,719
13, right, 13s are there.
It doesn't matter if it says 13.

205
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,439
It does... it's people's lunches!

206
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,279
All we have to do
is get them to the other end.

207
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,879
In the right order!
No, James, please just bung them in.

208
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,260
Don't, because we'll just
be having a race with the

209
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,639
train, which we could do anyway.
Bung, bung...

210
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,600
The point is to beat the
train AND make it work.

211
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,559
Bung yours in. Stop interfering!

212
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,999
I'm not interested in your view
on this. Go and do yours.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,959
There's a train! There's a train.
Just load up now.

214
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,200
I've lost count now.

215
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
This is hacking me off!
If they're not in the right

216
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,719
order we can't claim to
have beaten the system.

217
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,640
Just stop fretting about that and
load it up! Right! No time to lose.

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,359

220
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh, for God's sake!

221
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,079
The 12s and the odds... What?
He's gone.

222
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,519
How many has he taken? About 12.

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,280
You are kidding? In total? Yeah.
What a moron.

224
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
'The train and I left the station
at exactly the same moment.'

226
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,159
Over the years, I have raced
a Japanese bullet train,

the Swiss railway network,

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,199
the French railway network
and never lost.

229
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,720
I don't intend to lose now!

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,439
Coming through, coming through.

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,679

lowered suspension even lower still.

Come on, man.

237
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,919
Here are the figures...
the train has got a 14...mile journey

238
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,319
and is scheduled to take 44 minutes.

239
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,919
My journey is 17 miles.

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,600
17 miles, 44 minutes,
that means I must average...

241
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,799
Green, 18. Green, green,
green, then yellow.

242

HORNS BLARE Come on,
lunches, in a hurry.

243
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,320
People's lunches,
coming through.

244
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm fine for tea towels, thank you.
No, thank you. Thank you, no.

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,719
17 miles, 60 miles an hour. No...

246
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,080
If it was an hour, about...

'By this stage, Captain OCD
had finally joined the race.'

248

Correct use of the horn there to
warn of your presence going past.

249
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm going to try and
go to the outskirts of

250
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:40,679
the city slyly and do
a ring-road approach.

251
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,520
I think that'll be quicker. It's
a bit further, but it'll be quicker.

252
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,279
Oh, for crying out loud!

253
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,679
The one bit of open road
and look what I've got behind me...

254
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,919
Bombay 5-0.

255
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,799
Hello, officer. Hello, officer,
doing the speed limit.

256
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,120
That has got the hallmarks
of a massive thunderstorm.

257
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,039
As the train sped along,
my journey, thanks to Jeremy,

258
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,400
continued to be nerve wracking
and unpleasant.

259
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,080
Oh! I heard the food move.

260
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,719
Ah! My tins are rattling.

261
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
Ow!

262
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,159
This is just too easy,
I'm making cracking progress.

263
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,199
Test. It's fine.
BUZZER SOUNDS

264
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
TYRES SCREECH

265
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,599
Yes, it's raining.

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,719
THUNDER SOUNDS

267
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Bloody hell!

268
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,159
This is a big rainstorm now.

a few moments but, as in any city,

to revolutionise dabbawaling

272

of payments' deficit.

Come on!

sovereign nation of Great Britain.

276
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,199
On a mission...

277
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,159
Right, this is not good, it's clear
here. I'm going to go this way.

278
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,480
LOUD CLATTER

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh!

280
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,720
14 minutes to go.
Come on, come on, come on.

281
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,960
We may have bitten off more than we can
chew, in this traffic. We may have done.

282
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,960
I'm pretty sure this right is right.
HORNS BLARE

283

Yes, most of that will go in there.

You see.

285
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,599
OK, there will be shouting from those
people who don't get their lunch.

286
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,920

There it is, there it is!

Come o-o-o-n!

296

must be quite a big ring.

297

This doesn't look very teeming
20-million-inhabitant- Indian-city-ish.

298

I arrived at the station.'

I've beaten the others,
but more importantly...

303
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,799
I've beaten the train.

'This was good news for Britain.'

305
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,200
What do you think of that, chaps?

306

Yes, now, listen...

but MUCH hotter than usual.

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,279
Having achieved an accuracy rating
in our delivery service of just 4%,

327
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,119
we decided to abandon dabbawaling
and head north to Jaipur.

328
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,720
But instead of driving, the producer
insisted we take an overnight train.

329
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,360
They CANNOT be serious!
That is not a motor rail carriage.

330
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,079
How do you lose Bombay? I didn't
lose it so much, I overshot. What?

331
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,559
You can't miss it... it's enormous!
I tried to do a clever ring road.

332
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,759
It's the biggest place
we've ever been.

333
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,159
Why do you think the producer is
making us go on the train to Jaipur?

334
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,479
I don't know.
Why wouldn't he make us drive?

335
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,359
I was quite happy in my Rolls-Royce.
I was... There's nothing...

336
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,079
It's a slightly dangerous road,
but... It's a bit unexpected.

337
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,999
I think I know why. Why?

338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,519
A-hem...

339
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,580
Because HE doesn't want to drive.
Oh, yes!

340
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:43,639
The producer drives the Allegro.

341
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,399
He doesn't want to drive
in the back-up car.

342
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,279
It overheats, so you have
to have the heater on full.

343
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
Yeah.
I wouldn't want to drive that. No.

344
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
Having loaded our cars, we went
to get our tickets. However...

345
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,519
The queue goes all the way in there.

346
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,480
I can't do queuing. Really? I can't.

347
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:14,639
Manual labour and queuing are the
only two things in life I can't do.

348
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,879
But I really physically can't.
No, I can't either.

349
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,359
I do this queue sweary thing.

350
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,639
I can go for so long and then (BLEEP)
it just happens. Did it happen then?

351
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,239
I can't... Ha, ha haaa! It's happened
again. Right, off you go, then.

352
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,999
So you don't mind...
because he doesn't like... Go.

353
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Are you sure you don't mind?

354
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:35,839
He doesn't like us, that's what's
going on. You may have a point. Go.

355
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,119
You absolutely...
He doesn't mind queuing!

356
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,039
I do, but I'd rather queue than
listen to you two bleating.

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,239
Arse! That was a gentle one,
but it gets a lot worse.

358
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,719
I'll take him for a beer.
I'll look after him.

359
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,840
Beer helps. That'll fix it.

360
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,400
As James inched forward...

361
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,639
I went shopping and then
met up with Hammond for lunch.

362
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,320
Would you like... chicken lung soup?

363
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,639
No. No.

364
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,999
Little bit of lung?
No. You won't even taste it?

365
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,999
No, I'm really not hungry. I'm fine.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,799
Would you like me to give you
the present I've bought you?

367
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,959
Ooh, let me guess,
is it something impractical,

368
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,439
a bit ridiculous
and too big for the boot of a Mini?

369
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,759
Always so ungrateful. Honestly!

370
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,080
TANNOY: May I have your attention...

371
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,160
Hammond!

372
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,879
That's a double bass.
You like double basses.

373
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,719
I do like double basses very much.
Is that for me, seriously? Yep.

374
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,920
Thank you very much.
You're very kind.

375
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,719
I've had an idea.
You know when we get to Delhi? Yeah.

376
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,959
Why don't we have... cos this is what
most trade missions would do...

377
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,319
a party?

378
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,959
What, just, let's have a party?
If you have a party,

379
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,540
and invite the sort of
great and the good,

380
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,119
Indian commerce people,
ambassadors...

381
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,900
Oh, like a sort of
ambassadorial, Ferrero

382
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,680
Rocher type thing? Exactly that.

383
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,920
Hello. Three adults
for Jaipur, please.

384
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,639
Where would it be? Is it in a...?
What's it in? In a garden.

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,239
We could have a marquee. A garden
party! That's very British.

386
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,319
Come on!
This is actually a good idea.

387
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,239
It needs a focus, we're going
to have all British products

388
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,439
and our cars, and you walk around
and look at them and stuff.

389
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,560
But it needs a... What?
You need to...

390
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,359
What, you think we get
the Top Gear band back together?

391
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,760
What, so we entertain? I'm up for
that, I reckon that'll work. Cheers!

392
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,759
Many hours of queuing later,
Eeyore joined us on the platform.

393
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,799
What's this? We're getting the Top
Gear band back together! Yes, we are!

394
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,399
Come on. Yeah, we are.
Can you grab your keyboard?

395
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,959
I'll explain on the train.

396
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,359
Thank you. Sorry. Sorry, everybody.

397
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,479
This is a bass drum.

398
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,239
Oooh!

399
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:46,480
Ooh, it's crowded!

400
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,680
'A hot, 18-hour journey lay ahead.

401
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:56,719
'So, to cheer everyone up,
we roped in our producer on vocals

402
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:59,520
'and set to work,
practising the song we'd be

403
00:24:59,521 --> 00:25:02,320
performing at our
ambassadorial reception.'

404
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,119
âª Any time you feel the pain

405
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,319
âª Hey, Jude, refrain

406
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:12,359
âª Don't carry the world

407
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:16,559
âª Upon your shoulder

408
00:25:16,560 --> 00:25:21,560
âª Na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na

409
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:28,039
âª Na-na-na-na-na-na... âª

410
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:31,359
'The other passengers were reluctant
to join in on the chorus,

411
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,399
'but then Jeremy had a brainwave.'

412
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:36,759
I tell you what's better, why don't
we change the words? Naan!

413
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:41,559
Hey!
# Naan-naan-naan-naan-na-na-naan

414
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:42,840

417
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,039
Everybody!

âª Naan-naan-naan-naan-na-na-naan

419
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,319

the song was perfected,

420
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,000
'but we still had six hours to go.'

421
00:26:10,001 --> 00:26:14,519
'So we had a discussion about how the
time could be used productively.'

422
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:19,799
You know this train is like
a big billboard? Or could be.

423
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:22,999
How? Think,
it's going right through India

424
00:26:23,000 --> 00:26:25,759
and there are no slogans at all
on the outside.

425
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,799
And there are a billion people
in India.

426
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:31,759
How can we benefit from that?
If we got some banners,

427
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:35,559
we can promote Britain
as the train's going along.

428
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:38,999
We can't use product names, because
it's the BBC, but stuff like IT,

429
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,959
everybody I know works in IT.
Literally everybody. Financial services.

430
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:45,919
Food. How could we do...?
Everybody loves...

431
00:26:45,920 --> 00:26:48,719
Is HP sauce still...?
Is it American? Roast beef?

432
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,079
We're known for that.
We can't promote beef.

433
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,959
No, not here. No, you're right.

434
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,599
You've got French fries,

435
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:58,599
Belgian waffles.

436
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,279
What about English crumpets?

437
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,520
No, that's not very good, is it?

438
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:09,359
'Eventually,
we decided on our slogan.'

439
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,999
'So, at the next stop, Hammond
went off to buy some materials.'

440
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,680
TRAIN WHISTLE
Hammond, run!

441
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:17,559
HE LAUGHS
I got it!

442
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,479
'And then we got painting.'

443
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:23,439
OK. Right, James, unravel.

444
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:24,599
Unravelling.

445
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,039
It's like ticker-taping
Times Square. That's quite good.

446
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:30,560
We're like an enormous,
weird typewriter.

447
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,239
'With the banner complete,

448
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:36,799
'we had to hang it
on the outside of the train.'

449
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:38,879
I'm going to open this door. Right.

450
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,079
I'm going to feed the banner
out of it,

451
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,599
where the slipstream of the train
will carry it to Hammond,

452
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:46,760
who's waiting at the next door.
Whoa!

453
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:49,880
Here we go.

454
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:54,399
More!

455
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:56,320
I need more!

456
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,759
Hammond!

457
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,759
Try to do it when there are no posts!

458
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,520
Argh!

459
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:10,640
Got it.

460
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:17,280
Got to get it higher. Bring
it back in. No, just lift it up.

461
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:20,840
No, because it's already dragging...
THUD

462
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,919
When does it stop next?

463
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,600
THEY SCREAM

464
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,439
'Hammond made some more banners

465
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:37,399
'and we decided
our best chance of success

466
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,160
'was to hang them on the side of the
train when it stopped at stations.'

467
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,719
This has to be the most efficient
thing we've ever done in our lives.

468
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:48,639
We've never done anything
efficient. No, but we have to be.

469
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:50,399
I know. Yes.

470
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,119
Speed is everything.

471
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:55,319
What we've done is enlisted
the entire production team

472
00:28:55,320 --> 00:28:58,879
to help us hang the banner
on the outside of the train now,

473
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,239
because it's stopped
for 18 minutes.

474
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:05,079
Are we ready? Are we ready?
Yes, yes, yes. Steady.

475
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:07,960
Go! Go, go, go! Hit it.

476
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:21,920
I think we've done well there.

477
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:28,199
'With one banner in place,
we were like a well-oiled machine

478
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,360
'when we got to the next stop.'

479
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:35,599
Now THAT is marketing.

480
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,000
And the result is all of
these people here are

481
00:29:38,001 --> 00:29:40,399
going to go home and
want an English muffin.

482
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:44,199
You hear about these trade missions
to far-flung places in the world,

483
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:48,239
and you just know they're not doing
this kind of thing.

484
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,359
Prince Andrew is not hanging
from a side of a train in Kuwait,

485
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,319
saying, "Buy diggers.
" He isn't doing that. TRAIN TOOTS

486
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,240
The signal. We've got to go, guys.

487
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,560
'Our mobile billboard for UK Plc
was now complete.'

488
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:13,799
'However, at the next station, James
insisted on doing some repairs.'

489
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,759
James, leave it. You haven't done it
properly. Leave it. It on, it's on.

490
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,559
TRAIN TOOTS
Whoa, my God!

491
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Run! Run!

492
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
Quick, get on, get on.

493
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,719
James, run. Pull the cord. Run!

494
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,159
Pull the cord! Pull the cord!

495
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,040
No, there's a...

496
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,919
Hammond. Yeah? To stop the train
you pull the chain. Yeah.

497
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,359
But there's a fine of 1,000 rupees.

498
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,799
That's about 13 quid. Ã£13. I mean...

499
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,839
I haven't got that sort of money.

500
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,440
I'm not paying 13 quid. No, no, no.

501
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,039
'Eventually,
we arrived at our stop, Jaipur,

502
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,160
'a town seemingly famous
for its natural springs.'

503
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,940
'We paused for a while
to wish our banners

504
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:12,840
well on their journey
across India.'

505
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,559
That is a proud moment.
Isn't it? It is.

506
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,799
I just wish James was here to see...
Our message.

507
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,240
Our message to the subcontinent.

508
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,600
Oh, God.

509
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
Oh. It's going to Delhi.

510
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,080
What's it going to say
on the other side?

511
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,039
'To make matters worse,

512
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,999
'it looked like Jeremy's
dabbawalla delivery in Bombay

513
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,160
'hadn't gone that well after all.'

514
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,559
'Then, when we unloaded
James's Rolls,

515
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,639
'we discovered we'd been betrayed.'

516
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,320
When you get in here,
you're in for a nasty surprise.

517
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,799
Er, feel that.

518
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,359
But there's cool air. Yes.

519
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,639
Yes, yes.

520
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,559
Devious...

521
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,999
He told us it was broken. Is it?

522
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,879
Oh! The thing is, though,

523
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,159
you know Gandhi?
Er, yeah, was he a Rolls man? No.

524
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,359
Absolutely not.

525
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,479
Now, Gandhi argued
there was too big a gulf

526
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,119
in India between the rich and
the poor and it should be narrower.

527
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,359
And I think if we disabled
James's air conditioning,

528
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,239
it would make him more equal to us.

529
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,719
And that's good not just for us,

530
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,440
but also spiritually for him.
Exactly.

531
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,840
Gandhi would approve of what I'm
doing now. This is a noble act. Oh.

532
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,639
Nothing to see here.
Nothing to see here.

533
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,679
Beautiful British engineering.

534
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,119
If we do it back up again,
there's no evidence.

535
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,199
No, none. It's the perfect crime.
It IS the perfect crime.

536
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,879
No tools...

537
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,960
no murder weapon. No.

538
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,759
'Eventually, Judas arrived.'

539
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,199
May! You've made it.

540
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,959
Well done. How did you miss it?

541
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,920
What you couldn't see from the train

542
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,199
was the platform ended and there was
a drop of 15ft. I did see that.

543
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,460
I couldn't do anything.
That's why I shouted, "Pull the cord.

544
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:33,719
" Why didn't you?
There's a fine.

545
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,999
13 quid. But the good news is,

546
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,919
the cars have all arrived,
amazingly, in one piece.

547
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,839
Is it nice to see them?
I've also had a really good idea

548
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,720
for what we can do
while we're in Jaipur.

549
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,020
'My plan was to promote
the British motorsport

550
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:54,679
industry by staging a
hill-climb event.'

551
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,200
'Which, of course,
meant finding a hill.'

552
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,839
Oh, yes!

553
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,680
Nice little course,
one kilometre. Perfect.

554
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,780
And what we've done
is invited some local

555
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:13,599
Indians to bring whatever
vehicles they have

556
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,480
to see how fast
they can get up the hill.

557
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,280
It should be a good day's sport.

558
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,780
'But, of course, not only
would the Indians get a

559
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:23,279
flavour of this traditional
British motorsport,

560
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,279
'we'd have a chance to see
what sort of vehicles are favoured

561
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,400
'by the Indian petrol head.'

562
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,719
Go! Yeah! He's off.

563
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,640
He's away! We're underway!
We've done something.

564
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,719
What was that motorcycle?
Because this is our leaderboard.

565
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,479
That was the Rajdoot 175.

566
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,759
'Moments later,
we got out first time.'

567
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
One minute, 20.6. Is that fast?
We don't know.

568
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,559
'Next up was
the Hindustan Ambassador,

569
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,839

as a Morris Oxford

'and is still being produced
in Calcutta 63 years later.'

571
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,959
Go!

572
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,079
Has he gone? He's still going.
Whoa! Still going.

573
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,039
Whoa!

574
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,160
That's the smell
of Britain in the '50s.

575
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,319
'When the Hindustan had finished,

576

Go!

580
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,000
Less smoke.

'It may only have a 600cc
two-cylinder engine,

'but that didn't stop it
from putting on a good show.'

583
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,479
1.14.7. Oh, that's our first
blistering time of the day.

584
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,599
That is a quick car.
It's blindingly quick.

585
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,920
You know what's going to happen?

586
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:47,239
He'll think, "I'll go up that
hill again next weekend."

587
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,359
"I wonder if I can go a bit faster?
If I get that British fuel pipe hose..."

588
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,679
"I could improve..." And somebody in
Britain who makes hoses... Gets a sale.

589
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,439
Gets a sale.

It's going backwards.

It's going, it's going,
it's going, it's going.

That's better.
I've got cancer now(!)

595
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,599
You know the Reliant Robin
is not a stable vehicle,

596
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,040
as I have proved many times?
THAT makes the

597
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,480
Reliant Robin look like
a railway locomotive.

Good luck. 'ln fact, our hill climb
was so popular... '

out of control.'

'Eventually, the police arrived,
but only so they could have a go.'

607
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,079
It's a heck of a grid.
I would watch this on TV. I would.

608
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,320
More than Formula One.

609

'With the leaderboard almost full,
it was now our turn to set a time,

We need to demonstrate that our cars
are good. Yes. They're British.

(WHISPERING) We don't want...
Well, a little bit.

613
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,559
A little bit of winning.
No, no. No winning at all.

614
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,279
WHISPERING INDISTINCT
We really can't.

615
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,340
A small win?
We're hosting the event.

616
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:46,399
You'd have to present
the prize to yourself!

617
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,839
'Having made Jeremy promise he
wouldn't win, I lined up the Mini.'

618

Three, two, one!

00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,839
TYRES SCREECH

620
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,000
And we're off.
This is what the Mini was born to do.

621
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,359
This thing won the Monte Carlo Rally

622
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,580
and watching one of these
in classic touring

623
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,800
car racing was utterly,
utterly brilliant.

624
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,399
Every major racing driver
of the period had one.

625
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,720
Enzo Ferrari had THREE
of these things!

626
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,199
HE LAUGHS

627
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,520
I am upholding a legend here.

628
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,759
Finish line in sight.
Oh, I can't go too... I mustn't win.

629
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,119
Nobody can see. I'm going to give
myself a ten-second penalty, because...

630
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,759
I don't want to... You know, I...

631
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,239
Yeah, that'll do.

632
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,279
And across the line!

633
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,239
'Hammond's diplomacy
worked brilliantly.'

634
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,519
'And now it was my turn.'

635
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,839
Begin.

636
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,079
Still going by, still going by.
Still going by. Oh, it's gone.

637
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,079
A Rolls-Royce, of course,
has no real motor-sport heritage,

638
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,560
apart from a rally the Shadow
entered in the '60s.

639
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:56,039
Didn't do very well
and that commends it to me.

640
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,599
HE MAKES CREAKING NOISES
Big old lead. This is James.

641
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,040
Yeah. The grill will just...

642
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,039
Remember, a Rolls-Royce is designed
to stop you driving like a hooligan.

643
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,080
It sort of says,
"Are you sure, sir?"

644
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Mid-race check. Everything's good.
BUZZER SOUNDS

645
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,959
We're both suffering with gut sweat.
Yeah. It's interesting here,

646
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,559
you don't need your penis.

647
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,599
You drink and drink and drink and it
just comes out of everywhere else.

648
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,480
This is not needed.
Thank you, Dr

649
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:31,360
Clarkson, that's an
interesting theory(!)

650
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,120
Here we are at the finish.

651
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,679
'James, too, posted
a thoughtful and considerate time.'

652
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,199
'Now, we could only hope
the orang-utan would do the same.'

653
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,519
Jeremy. What? You're starting off
halfway across the line.

654
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,959
It's for fun! Why are you wearing
a helmet? I don't know. My helmet?

655
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,439
Because it wedges my head in,
so I don't roll about.

656
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,479
What's that on the dash? Stopwatch.

657
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,519
Why? We've got a stopwatch.
No, I want to see what I'm doing.

658
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,519
In three, two, one... go.

659
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,119
TYRES SCREECH
Yes, here we go!

660
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,999
The Jag, of course,
has a fine motor-sport pedigree.

661
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,759
And you can feel that pedigree
as I unleash it through the esses.

662
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,599
He wants to finish about 1:16.

663
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,759
Between the Mini and the Rolls,
because that what you'd expect.

664
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,519
Kiss the apex!
Power it out of there.

665
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,319
Up the hill.

666
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,839
The only problem I've got, really,
is the gear box won't kick down.

667
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,640
That's because it's a ZF
box, made by Germans.

668
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:40,439
And I'm just telling
you, if you're Indian,

669
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,320
"German" is a byword
for shoddy quality.

670
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,160
He'll stop.
He'll take a break before the top.

671
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,480
I told him to pause and then...

672
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,680
And there's the finishing line.
Power!

673
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,039
And so, in third place,

674
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,599
the Maruti jeep driven by Nitish.
Where are you? Well done. Well done.

675
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,799
And, in second place,
the Tata Nano, driven by Sorab.

676
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,159
Well done, well done.
Good man, well done.

677
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,840
So, the winner of the
inaugural Top Gear

678
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:12,519
All-India British
Hill-speed Climb Event...

679
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,919
is the Jaguar XJS driven by Jeremy...
HE TAILS OFF

680
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
Yes! There you go.
Thank you very much. So...

681
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,879
Oh, God...people of India.

682
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,640
'Thanks to Jeremy, the hill climb
had not been a diplomatic success.'

683
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,199
'But then, Jaipur itself gave us
an idea for making amends.'

684
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,719
'In 1876, the whole city was painted
pink to celebrate a visit

685
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,999
'by the then Prince of Wales.'
So we thought we'd reciprocate

686
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,560
'by splitting up and decorating
our cars to celebrate India.'

687
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,359
Right. I'm going to focus my efforts
on here.

688
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,559
What I'm going to go for is a flag.

689
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,159
I already have a Union Jack
on the roof.

690
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,439
If I put Indian flag on the bonnet,

691
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,039
it's kind of the two brought together
on one iconic symbol of Britishness.

692
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,160
It's like a hands across the ocean,
but it's hands across the windscreen.

693
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,160
That is good, that is good.
Nice. Look at that.

694
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,680
Yee ha!

695
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,679
It's good? Good?

696
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,040
You like a flock wallpaper?
BOYS: Yes, yes.

697
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,940
There's a design in the
middle which is...

698
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:32,160
Oh, it'll be something
like an eagley thing.

699
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,159
Eventually, I was done,
so I went to join Jeremy.

700
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,200
DRUMS PLAY

701
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,919
Loving your shirt.
Loving your boob tube.

702
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,439
It's a crop top is what it is,
and this is...?

703
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,319
That's for Anglo-Indian relations.

704
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,839
That's the British flag. Yeah, and
the...? That is the Indian flag.

705
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,720
But the whole car is Ganesh themed.

706
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:04,639
Ganesh being this elephant god?
Yes.

707
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,079
They have an expression,
"We're doing a Ganesh",

708
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,400
meaning making sure something
starts auspiciously.

709
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:11,719
I've got more elephant
themes inside.

710
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,479
Have you gone mental? No.

711
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,800
Oh, I'll just light my joss stick.
Get a smell of this.

712
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,479
Now, you see, that's weed!
No, it's not!

713
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,079
THEY LAUGH

714
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,599
Well, I have to say...
No, credit where credit's due.

715
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,839
YOU don't deserve any.

716
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,799
But wait until you see
what I've done to the Jag.

717
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,319
First of all, the flock effect
racing stripe. Like that.

718
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,759
But this is genius.

719
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,719
At some point on this trip, Hammond's
Bombay doors are going to break.

720
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,439
We'll be stuck
in the middle of nowhere

721
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,840
and he is going to beg me
for use of this.

722
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,919
What I've done in there... Well,
I... No, it's like an ice bucket.

723
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,800
You fill it up with chemicals.

724
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,639
This is the best thing I've ever
seen fitted to a car in India.

725
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,199
Everybody who comes here
gets the trots.

726
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,680
Yeah. And you've got...

727
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,919
No, it's very good. The thinking is
terrific. I've also tuned my badge

728
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,639
to match the temperatures
I'm experiencing in the car.

729
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,599
It's an Aga. I've taken the "J",
the "U" and the "R" out

730
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,039
and we're left with "Aga",
which is what it is.

731
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,999
'At that moment,
Rolf Harris arrived.'

732
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,840
What have you been doing?

733
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,519
Craftsmanship takes time.
Indian flag, Union Jack.

734
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,060
You see? It's a symbol
of British craftsmanship

735
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:36,599
and ingenuity brought together.
It's all there.

736
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,359
I'm pretty certain
that's not an Indian flag. It is.

737
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,560
There's a green, a white
and a red-orange stripe.

738
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,759
I didn't do the
red-orange because...

739
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,719
I think that's in Indian one
and the stripes go HORIZONTAL.

740
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,399
You'd recognise a Union Jack
if it was that way. HORIZONTAL.

741
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,559
You're looking at it from this side.
Hold on a minute.

742
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,239
You've got one there.
It's a grapefruit in the middle.

743
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,319
It's segmented. Would you agree
that what he's done is that flag?

744
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,640
Yes, near enough. Would you like to
know what country that is the flag of?

745
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,560
THEY LAUGH

746
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,119
Of all the countries YOU in
particular could have selected,

747
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,759
what you've done, Richard Hammond,
is paint on your Mini

748
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,039
the flag of Mexico.

749
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,560
God, I haven't, have I? You have.

750
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,319
Maybe you should put a piece
of lemon in the fuel filler neck,

751
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,920
see if it makes it go better.
THEY CONTINUE TO LAUGH

752
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,159
It was now time to head north
to Delhi,

753
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,719
to host our important
ambassadorial trade reception.

754
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,439
However, at that moment, James had
something more pressing on his mind.

755
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,799
Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute.
It's very hot in here and you two,

756
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,919
I left you two with my car yesterday
when I was in the tuk tuk.

757
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,559
Oh, dear. You've interfered
with my air conditioning.

758
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,479
It's coming out red hot.
'You took it off the train!

759
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,759
'How can we mess with something that
you told us was already broken?'

760
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,639
Yes, but it WAS working
and now it isn't.

761
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,999
Ha! 'You've been fiddling with it.'

762
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,119
So you're now saying it WAS working
and now it isn't working?

763
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,679
Yes, I was lying about it not
working. It works perfectly well,

764
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,919
I was just keen for you two
not to start messing around with it.

765
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,639
'Have you messed around with it?'

766
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,839
Well, in the spirit
of new-found honesty, yes,

767
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,439
we ruined your air conditioning.

768
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,079
Well, what was the bloody point
of that, you idiot?!

769
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,120
Gandhi made us do it.

770
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,919
What a pair of morons. That's all
they can do, break something.

771
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
They can't make anything or mend
anything, just break stuff.

772
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,640
It's the ruin of Britain.

773
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,839
The journey to Delhi
would give us our first taste

774
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,959
of life on provincial
Indian highways.

775
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,600
An experience which,
we'd been told, would be terrifying.

776
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,799
Let me give you
some alarming statistics.

777
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,279
Throughout India,
there are now 74 million vehicles,

778
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,359
roughly twice what we have
in the UK.

779
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,079
So you'd expect the death rate
to be twice as high. It isn't.

780
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,239
In Britain, around about 3,000 people
a year are killed on the roads.

781
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,599
Last year in India, it was 196,000.

782
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,920
That's 22 an hour.

783
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,319
This country has the most dangerous
roads in the world.

784
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,840
And they get worse at night.

785
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,999
This was a problem for us,

786
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,759
because as night fell, our overnight
hold was still 80 miles away.

787
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,280
And we were on the most dangerous
kind of road... a dual carriageway.

788
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,319
HORNS BLARE

789
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,240
Jesus Christ, that car's going
on the wrong side of the road.

790
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,160
Unlit tractor up ahead, chaps.

791
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,599
That's completely unlit.

792
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,160
An unlit wide-load in the dark
on an unlit road.

793
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,800
Oh, a man on the road. God!

794
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,120
Oh, this is tight. Oh.

795
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,159
Oh.

796
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,480
Oh, that was scary.

797
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,359
Bloody hell!
HORN BLARE

798
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,639
You know in England, when a child
is badly behaved, the mother says

799
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,559
"Your father will be very cross
with you when he gets home"?

800
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,999
Here, it's different. It's, "Your
father will be very cross with you"

801
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,200
"IF he gets home."

802
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh, God. Oh, God!

803
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,760
Jesus, look at that.

804
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,840
I mean, Ganesh, look at that.

805
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,120
Blinded. Yep, can't see a thing.

806
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,879
That lorry's very close.

807
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,679
TYRES SCREECH

808
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,199
BLEEP

809
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,760
"Road narrows
for no obvious reason."

810
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,920
Oh, strewth!

811
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,119
Two nerve-jangling hours later,

812
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,839
we arrived at the town
where we'd be staying the night.

813
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,400
And as we refuelled,
I took my revenge.

814
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,999
Funny. Very funny.

815
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,039
Er, what James has done
is turned my heater up to full,

816
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,759
and then removed the heater knob
so I can't turn it back down again.

817
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,080
What a monumental bell-end he is.

818
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,520
The next morning, the dual
carriageway madness continued.

819
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,280
Only now, we could actually see
what was going to kill us.

820
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,160
Oh, God, now look.

821
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,640
Holy moly.

822
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,919
The man here just got out of his
lorry in the middle of the road.

823
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,680
Whoa!

824
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,440
HORNS BLARE
Oh!

825
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,599
I wonder how much else
we missed last night.

826
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,440
What else was going on
that we never saw?

827
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,039
So the Allegro survived the night
by the looks of things

828
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,919
and is still with us, with a very
miserable-looking producer at the helm.

829
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,279
Serves him right for having no faith

830
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,359
in these magnificent British cars
that we've chosen.

831
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,919
James, is your car giving
the slightest indication

832
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,239
it might go wrong?

833
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,719
No. Situation update.
HE HONKS HORN

834
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,519
Oil level
and coolant temperature good.

835
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,879
Everything working.
Engine is as sweet as a nut.

836
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,120
My karma is very good.

837
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,039
'And at the next fuel stop,
his karma got even better,

838
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,440
'as he turned his special
revenge gun on Hammond.'

839
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,599
James...
The seat is stuck forwards, James.

840
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,279
Have you missed
with the seat in my car?

841
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,520
Might have done.

842
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,159
Where have you put my knob?
I've forgotten.

843
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,119
It's so hot in there. Look.

844
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,920
My tablecloth has leaked dye
into my shirt.

845
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,439
'Several hours later,
we arrived in Delhi,

846
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,079
'where I decided
to have an accident.'

847
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,839
O... K!

848
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,239
'Sadly, there was no time
to worry about this small crash,

849
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,800
'because that night, we were hosting
our trade reception.'

850
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,359
It's very obvious that this is
the right place for our party.

851
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,160
Lots of rich, influential people
behind these high walls and hedges.

852
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,600
We will do well here.

853
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,559
After a quick freshen up, we arrived
at the location for our party...

854
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,439
an exclusive house
in the select embassy district.

855
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,240
Brilliant, look at this. It's good,
isn't it? This is fantastic.

856
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,719
Our guests would be arriving
in just a few hours,

857
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,039
so James started to build
the catering tent,

858
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,279
I washed the cars and Hammond took
charge of decorating the marquee.

859
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,399
Gather round.

860
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,279
What we need to do is make this
the colours of the Union Jack,

861
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,759
British flag, so I brought some
red, white and blue cloth with me

862
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,799
so we can decorate it.

863
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,639
So to your posts for now
and I'll work out a plan.

864
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,680
If you each go
and stand with one of these. Yes.

865
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,480
Anybody speak English?

866
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,439
Good.

867
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,840
ENGINE REVS

868
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,719
I'm getting them
in a fan shape, James.

869
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,559
No, that's OK, like that, yeah.
Keep going.

870
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,000
OK.

871
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,959
We'll have do untie it
and start again.

872
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,000
This setback meant James would have
to start his cooking al fresco.

873
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,039
Tonight's dish
is a signature British dish,

874
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,879
but celebrates our relationship with
India, particularly our love of spices.

875
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,079
It is, obviously,
coronation chicken.

876
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,559
And the ingredients
are chicken and coronation.

877
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,759
To make the coronation, you start
with a bowl and some salad cream.

878
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,479
So you've got salad cream chicken,
basically? And spices.

879
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,879
Why have you got digestive biscuits?
It's going to be served on them.

880
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,039
That's the stupidest idea...
Why don't you go and wash the cars?

881
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,879
I've washed them. You haven't.

882
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,479
I can see that it's still dirty and
still says "penis" on the bonnet.

883
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,159
I squirted them with water.
That's not good enough.

884
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,999
We're using Madras curry powder
from the Midlands.

885
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,719
Sprinkle that on...

886
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,439
Salad cream and curry powder
is what it is? Pretty much.

887
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,640
It's got sultanas...

888
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,879
Go and wash the cars.
Go and wash the cars.

889
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,000
Now they're having a water fight.
Gentlemen!

890
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,839
Once James had finished his recipe...
Coronation chicken, madam?

891
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,599
He went into town to buy fireworks,
leaving me alone with the orang-utan.

892
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,959
This is magnificently brilliant.

893
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,799
I think the guests are going
to just adore having a go in this.

894
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,640
A bit of tweed action going on.
THUD

895
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,680
Oh, no!

896
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,279
Oh, my God.

897
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,719
'Between us, we worked out
that James was going to notice.'

898
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,919
Have you got any green paint? No.

899
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,840
Yes. Yes! You have? We've brought
a load of Airfix models. Have we?

900
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,000
Spitfire green. Yes, here we go.
We can have this fixed.

901
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,440
I don't think he's got enough
of his instruments painted over.

902
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,999
JEREMY LAUGHS

903
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,760
That's much better.

904
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,919
A bit later on,
James returned with his fireworks,

905
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,640
which, frankly,
were not what I'd had in mind.

906
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,159
James, I know you live in 1956,
but the world has moved on,

907
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,199
these are pathetic. They'll be good.

908
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,159
These are big as well.
They're rubbish.

909
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,719
There's a limit to the size
of fireworks you can have

910
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,479
in, let's be honest, the middle of the
Government area, lots of embassies,

911
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,439
on a high state of alert
because of the threat of terrorism.

912
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,839
You can't let off
a millennium fireworks...

913
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,599
it's a garden fireworks display.

914
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,919
That's going to be like lighting
a match. No, it isn't. It is.

915
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,559
'I decided to take matters in hand.'

916
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,199
OK, what you need to make
a really big firework is, er...

917
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,399
a length of drainpipe,
a cane, teaspoon, Sellotape,

918
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,039
sharp knife, saucer
and a pair of pixellated hands,

919
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,479
so you at home
can't see what I'm doing.

920
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,999
Right, you take, well, any firework.

921
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,519
Let's start
with this relatively small one.

922
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,839
And you apply the sharp knife.

923
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,719
Now, being very careful
not to hit the...

924
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,640
Let's not give that a name.

925
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,959
Our plan was to show
our top business guests

926
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,199
some of Britain's finest products,

927
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,559
with each of us championing
one particular thing.

928
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,400
James selected a superb lawnmower.

929
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,999
Oh, that is...

930
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,559
And as it winds itself up, it gets
further in, that's brilliant.

931
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,279
You know what, that is actually...
It's all right, isn't it?

932
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,520
That's a good display.

933
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:07,439
'I would be promoting something
very close to my heart... '

934
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,759
Hair products.

935
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,799
It's a little-known fact
that we in Britain

936
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,439
are extensive producers
of a huge range of hair product.

937
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,039
Nicky Clarke, she's a well-known
hairdresser, I think.

938
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,119
What I'm going to do is arrange
a display, but more than that...

939
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,919
in keeping with the theme, which is
kind of active, actually doing stuff,

940
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,879
I'm going to style myself
and turn myself into a walking,

941
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,319
moving billboard.

942
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,359
You need to be able to remove,

943
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,599
from in here, all of the stuff that
looks a bit like it could belong

944
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,880
in a fondue set,
but isn't really the same.

945
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,719
By the time James had got
his lawnmower under control,

946
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,359
Jeremy had completed
his cruise missile.

947
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,639
Here we are.

948
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,879
The finished product.

949
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,639
My giant firework, with stick,
with prong on the end,

950
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,320
ready to be launched.

951
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,759
With that done, I was free to break
out the product I'd be promoting,

952
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,799
the Corby trouser press,
which I believed could perform

953
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,919
a vital extra service
for the Indian customer.

954
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,319
The Corby naan-press.
There it is.

955
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,000
Is it hot? Ooh, ah!

956
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,600
Mmm. That is good. Mm.

957
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,919
With the preparations complete,

958
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,720
it was time to smarten ourselves up
and greet our VIP guests.

959
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,920
How'd you do? Barley water, Tizer,
English wine, coronation chicken.

960
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,519
You do the wine, I'll go around
with coronation chicken.

961
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,719
'Meanwhile, Richard was in charge
of valet parking.'

962
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,800
Hello, welcome.

963
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:06,959
Right, thank you. I'm going
to put this somewhere prominent.

964
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,400
I love the paint, by the way.

965
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,400
Keys. Er... Oh, hello, that'll do.

966
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,959
It's powdered and you simply add
water and you get mashed potato.

967
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,359
I think it's better
than the real thing. Lovely.

968
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,599
Forgive me for interrupting,
I brought your vegetarian option.

969
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,879
This is a sweet one... Angel Delight
on a Digestive biscuit.

970
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,560
Hello. Hello, how are you?
I'm very well, thank you.

971
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,359
This is gentleman's relish on
a water biscuit and this is Marmite.

972
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,800
Right.

973
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,239
'As darkness fell,
the guests continued to arrive.'

974
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,959
If you'd like to park up there,
I'll do the proper park.

975
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,239
Yours is a temporary park.
I'm doing the big, actual park.

976
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,879
It's my job.
Move up, if you would, sir.

977
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,879
'With the party in full swing,

978
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,559
'it was time to demonstrate
our British products.

01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:13,120
'Sadly, though,

Bollocks.

981
01:00:15,640 --> 01:00:19,480
And Jeremy's diplomacy was as bad
as it had been at the hill-climb.

982
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,439
This is something I think
you could sell well in India.

983
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,080
Most British two or three-star
hotels have these.

984
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,039
Judging by the cars
that were turning up,

985
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,639
it was clear Delhi's elite
had come to the party.

986
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,839
But unfortunately for Richard,
they'd all arrived at once.

987
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,199
I'm your valet park... Oh, just wait
there, I'm going to park your car.

988
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,320
Just don't move.

989
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,679
Hold on. Nobody park.
No, where are they going? Agh!

990
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,479
I have a proper
British lawnmower at home,

991
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,239
an Atco twin-clutch,
but I don't actually have a lawn,

992
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,679
but it's still something that's very
pleasant to own, as an artefact,

993
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,919
as an example of fine engineering,
with a great engineering...

994
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,239
'So, James was boring everyone
to death,

'my parking system
was in disarray... '

997
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,839
Just one second. I just... Don't go.

998
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,999
'..and Jeremy was still being
a diplomatic nightmare.'

999
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,359
I could arrive at your house,
do my business,

1000
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,080
and then come and see you without
doing it all over your kitchen floor.

1001
01:01:24,680 --> 01:01:28,799
'Plainly, it was time to get
the Top Gear band on stage.'

1011
01:01:52,881 --> 01:01:56,279
For some reason,
the crowd wasn't warming to us,

1012
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,600
so I decided to set off
my firework.

EXPLOSION, GLASS SHATTERS

1017

ALARM SOUNDS

1018
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:16,079
Strangely, the guests took this
massive explosion as a cue to leave,

1019
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,360
but that was harder
than they thought.

1020
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,320
This one? It's not that one.

1021
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,959
The next morning,
we had to face the fact

1022
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,519
that our party had been a disaster.

1023
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,599
But it had been even worse than that
for Hammond.

1024
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,479
Just tell me what happened.
A very tall, willowy Indian girl

1025
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,239
wanted her photograph taken with me,
so she stood next to me.

1026
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,559
Yeah, yeah? And just as a man was
about to take the picture on a phone,

1027
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,159
a small creature,
an insect... a fly, perhaps...

1028
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,719
bit sharply into my right teste.

1029
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,399
Through your trousers?
I imagine it went up the leg.

1030
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,759
Well, it's not a long journey.
That's a long way, this is...

1031
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,678
Crawled all the way up
to bite you...

1032
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,160
It chose that moment...
"Yes, of course... agh!"

1033
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:07,679
I couldn't...
That's flat out. Look at it.

1034
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,319
So it's...

1035
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,399
So he's got
an out-of-control lawnmower,

1036
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,879
you have... A sore plum.
..a sore plum.

1037
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,799
I think it's now time
to leave the city, to leave Delhi,

1038
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,880
and get on
with our countryside mission.

1039
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,239
We decided to head even further
north, into the Himalayas,

1040
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,559
where our cars would be faced with
rough roads and mountainous terrain.

1041
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,839
So, to prepare them for this,
we found a workshop...

1042
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,639
and cue the music.

1043
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,080
MUSIC: Theme from "The A-Team"

1044
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,400
That's what I'm talking about.

1045
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,640
LOUD RASPING HUM

1046
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,999
OK, what I've done to the Jag is...

1047
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,399
is ruin it comprehensively.

1048
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,920
'I'd fitted much chunkier
tyres, which had

1049
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:24,439
meant messing around
with the suspension,

1050
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,199
'and this had had
a dramatic effect.'

1051
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,319
The ride is now intolerable,

1052
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,599
the tyres are catching
on the arches, as you can hear.

1053
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,079
The noise is simply unbearable,

1054
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,759
the braking is now very poor,
the rev counter has broken,

1055
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,799
BUT on the upside, though,

1056
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,599
because the exhaust now
goes straight out of the bonnet

1057
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,399
rather than under the car,
I have much more ground clearance,

1058
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,880
about that much more.

1059
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,400
HUMMING
Oh! Ho, ho, ho!

1060
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,519
James had also fiddled
with his suspension

1061
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,519
to accommodate the chunkier rubber.

1062
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,640
And he too had made
a complete mess of it.

1063
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,240
Oh, God!

1064
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,519
I've ruined everything.

1065
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,160
There's no point trying to say anything
intelligent, it's just too noisy.

1066
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,480
That is quite a noise, isn't it?
HE LAUGHS

1067
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,079
My car is fine,

1068
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,519
because I haven't modified
or messed about with it.

1069
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,599
I put it on some new tyres...
that's not modification,

1070
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,359
that's something you do. I put it
on rally tyres, just in case.

1071
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,719
I have fitted a sump guard to protect
the underside if it bottoms out,

1072
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,439
and the winch... that's not for me,

1073
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,279
that's to rescue those two idiots
WHEN they get stuck,

1074
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,800
which they will. That's it.

1075
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,080
The overnight hold
is 198 miles away.

1076
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,600
No!

arguing about whose car was worse.'

1078
01:06:07,240 --> 01:06:09,599

1079
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:12,759

fuel stop... '

'..we decided to swap.'

1083
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,359
What a shocking racket!

1084
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,920
LOUD THUMPING AND HUMMING

1085
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,080
Oh, my God!

1086

01:06:40,400 --> 01:06:42,999
There is smoke, isn't there,
coming from the Rolls?

1089
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,199
No, it's coming off the tyre.

1090
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,039
Oh, James,
you can have this back now.

1091
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,680
It's frightening.

1092
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,679
I'm really sorry, Mr Cameron.

1093
01:06:52,680 --> 01:06:57,080
Thanks to those two,
our trade mission is in tatters.

1094
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,439
Back in the Jag, I decided
to use my new PA system

1095
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,479

HE wouldn't enjoy.

1143
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,799
Your lawn, grown too long.

1144
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,079
Engage the lawnmower.

1145
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,879
It is simply blown away. Like that.
We'll work on that...

1146
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,159
'Nobody was very interested.

1147
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,719
'So, at the hotel that night,
to cheer ourselves up,

1148
01:10:45,720 --> 01:10:49,040
'Hammond and I decided
to improve May's Rolls.'

1149
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,999
What are you doing?
Thread that through his car.

1150
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,639
To the horn, in such a way...
Go and find the horn.

1151
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,839
Through the back seat.
Don't knock my beer over.

1152
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
I'm not going
to knock your beer over!

1153
01:11:04,280 --> 01:11:07,960

we woke up in Switzerland.

'It was also more peaceful as I had
fitted some silencers to my Jag.'

1156
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:27,639
On the upside, my new exhaust system
is much quieter than before.

1157
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,639
On the downside, it's making
a really annoying, jangling sound

1158
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,640
and I can't see where I'm going.

1159
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,799
Still, it could be worse.

1160
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:38,919
HORN BLARES

1161
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,439
HORN BLARES AGAIN

1162
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,400
Hammond? Yes!

1163
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,399
Can you hear a blowing noise?

1164
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,319
Oh, for God's sake!

1165
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,400
THEY LAUGH

1166
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,639
'What's the matter?'

1167
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,820
Well, I suspect you
know, but I'll explain

1168
01:11:58,821 --> 01:12:01,000
it to you anyway...
braking sounds the horn.

1169
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,359
HORN BLARES REPEATEDLY

1170
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,679
They've given me an interesting
game now... try to avoid braking.

1171
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,320
HORN BLARES

1172
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:18,159
'We continued onwards,
determined to take our trade mission

01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:27,520

1178
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,840
Oh!

1179
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,680
'So, we kept on climbing.'

1180
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,839
This is the road to China.

1181
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,959
Tibet. Can I say Tibet?

1182
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,719
I'm not sure what the politically
correct way of saying that is.

1183
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,600
Doubtless the BBC
has some ancient way of saying it.

1184
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,279
We're at 12,000 feet.

1185
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,960
One hell of a drop on the right.

1186
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,560
It's OK because there's a big row
of pebbles to stop me going over.

1187
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,120
On the plus side, though, at this
height, the views were staggering.

1188
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,319
Oh, oh!

1189
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,920
This is... something else.

1190
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,039
That stays with you for ever.

1191
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,320
Utterly beautiful.

1192
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,799
I know just the song
that will match the moment.

1193
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,759
No, it won't.

01:13:48,240 --> 01:13:52,439
'The magnificence of our
surroundings was all well and good,

1197

'but the views weren't translating
into business for Britain.'

1198
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,799
This has a last frontier feel
to it, this does. I hope it isn't.

1199
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,519
Not much call for trouser presses
or lawnmowers here,

1200
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:06,480
or hair products, if we're honest.

'But Richard, besotted with
his Mini, would hear none of it.'

1204
01:14:28,040 --> 01:14:31,199
I'll just keep going
until Everest comes into view

1205
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,760
and then deal with that.

1206
01:14:33,920 --> 01:14:36,119
Oh, that's bouncing.

1207
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,520
It hops from bump to bump!
HE GIGGLES

1208
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,759
This is actually quite unpleasant.

1209
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,679
But we must soldier on...

1210
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,400
for our country.

1211
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,519
The problem is that mud
and rock slides

1212
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,879
take this road away
every few months.

1213
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:12,039
Look, just a massive rock slide
there has ruined the road.

soon the road ahead was blocked.'

Come on, little Mini.

1222
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:51,440
Go on! There you go. Yeah!

Oh, come on, you can do this!

01:16:05,640 --> 01:16:08,279
Go, go, go!

1226
01:16:08,280 --> 01:16:11,159

'Finally,
it was George Harrison's go.'

Lord Ganesh,
make my climb auspicious.

1229
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:19,800

01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:36,120
Oh, no! So close!

1231
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,320
It looked very good for a moment.
It DID look very good.

1232
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,159
How much does that weigh, James?

1233
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,519
2.2 tonnes.

1234
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,599
2.2 tonnes of Rolls-Royce.

1235
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,119
Off-roading.

1236
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,879
Now, rock it out.

situations like this.

1239

Yeah, I'll give it the beans.

1253
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,479
Right! Jeremy, give it 1,500 rpm.

1254
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:47,520
Yes!

Keep the revs up, which I have.

Let's get it moved! Here we go now!

1258
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,559
Say when. I'm winching it in, taking
it up now, you should feel the pull.

I don't understand winching, but
I don't think that is part of it.

1264
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,319
It's not moving at all!

1265
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,959
Oh, hang on a minute. What?

1266
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,920
No, just give it some more revs!
No, stop!

James?

1270
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:03,959
Hello.

1271
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,840
Can you think of any way
that we can cheer Hammond up?

1272
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,599
Well, Genesis springs to mind.

1273
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,959
I'm thinking the same thing.

In fact, it was quite a while
before we heard from Hammond again.

01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,479
Guys, how far away is the hotel?
How many hours?

1281
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,159
'Er... about two hours.'

01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,359
'What suggestion?'

1291
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,399

01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,160
Sorry.

1298
01:20:46,640 --> 01:20:47,920

Why can't we ever do
a Christmas special one year where

we go from Monaco to Portofino?!

1306

How luxurious can this be?!

1307
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,300
I was the first to check
in to a five-star hotel.

1308
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:12,319
As you can see, I've
done it properly.

1309
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,159
A man's carrying all my bags. Yes.
But then Jeremy arrived. Yes.

1310
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,799
Diddly dee, dee, diddly dee!
"Oh, my word, Jeremy,"

1311
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,760
"look what you've got as your car?!"

1312
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:22,679
"It's the new Ferrari FF."

1313
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,759
I wonder where Hammond is?

1314
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,040
Hammond had indeed checked into a
Formule 1 in a Renault 4. THEY LAUGH

1315
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,119
The next morning, as I was
finishing off my Mini repairs,

1316
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,639
it was clear that Jeremy
hadn't had the best of nights.

1317
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,439
My pillow was just a pillowcase
soaked in glacial water

1318
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,119
and then filled with stones.

1319
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,679
My sleeping bag broke.
My blanket was see-through.

1320
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:03,959
My body was down to a temperature
hitherto unknown to science.

1321
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,360
I would have come and bludgeoned
you to death last night.

1322
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:08,760
But you're not moaning
about it, so that's OK(!)

1323
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,639
The misery of tenting
wasn't our only problem,

1324
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,799
because we were running out of India
and it was clear,

1325
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,280
looking back...

1326
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,040
that our trade mission
hadn't been a success.

1327
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,560
Thank you very much.

1328
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,399
CRASHING

1329
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,040
ALARM BLARES

1330
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,759
But then, in the next valley,
we came across some kids playing

1331
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,520
a rudimentary version
of India's most revered sport...

1332
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,079
which we decided
could be improved.

1333
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,639
Guys!

1334
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,879
Excuse me? Guys!

1335
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,279
What's this?

1336
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,599
Right, you ready, Hammo?

1337
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,160
Ready?!
HE REVS THE ENGINE

1338
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,959
Ohhh!

1339
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,159
Ready?!

1340
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,520
HE REVS THE ENGINE AGAIN

1341
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,199
'And so, outside the Hillview cafe,

1342
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,520
'high in the Himalayas,
straight six cricket was born.'

1343
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,399
Whoa! There it comes! Oh, very good!

1344
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,719
THEY LAUGH

1345
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,999
We burdened them
with the misery of cricket.

1346
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,480
Now, we're here to reinvent it.

1347
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,719
'In fact, it was such a hit,
we decided to have a Test match.'

1348
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,519
This is England versus India now!

1349
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,800
Our crew are going to do
some fielding.

1350
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,799
Good shot!

1351
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,079
New bowler, everybody. James May.

1352
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,000
HE REVS THE ENGINE

1353
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,479
Stat! Catch it!

1354
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,920
CHEERING

1355
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,439
Yes! Somebody's out!
Love your move!

1356
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,560
Good answer!

1357
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,679
'Half a tank of Jag fuel later,
the match was over

1358
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,959
'and India had won.'

1359
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,279
You know the Ashes?

1360
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,959
This is the bridge
from his double bass.

1361
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,839
We burn this and then
we present it in an urn...

1362
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,439
to you.

1363
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,280
'For the first time on our trade
mission, we'd got something right.

1364
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,679
'In burning a bridge,
we'd actually built a bridge

1365
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:48,679
'that would become a business bridge
of friendship and erm... trade.'

1366
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,679
Well, there, that was quite good.

1367
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,519
Careful. They're really hot. Hot!

1368
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,039
You have the Ashes. You have the
Ashes. Well done. See you in a year.

1369
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,199
Well done, everybody.
Back in a year!

1370
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,880
We're taking them home next year!

1371
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,040
There was something else
that we got right on this trip...

1372
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,480
our cars.

1373
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,280
This Jaguar has been...

1374
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,399
well, genuinely astonishing.

1375
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,399
It really has. It's done things
WAY beyond what was envisaged

1376
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,239
when it was designed.

1377
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,919
And really, it's been two cars...

1378
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,799
in Bombay and Jaipur,

1379
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,639
it was sleek and graceful and fast,

1380
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,439
whereas here in the mountains,

1381
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,399
it's just plain heroic.

1382
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,920
I really, genuinely love this car.

1383
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,279
I want an XJS in my life.

1384
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,719
There's just something about it
which is absolutely brilliant.

1385
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,679
ENGINE REVS

1386
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,920
I'm exhausted,
but the old girl isn't.

1387
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,079
While we're alone, viewers,
I'll be honest with you,

1388
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,399
I wasn't absolutely sure
I'd make it in a Rolls-Royce.

1389
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,439
I always knew it was a gamble. And I
was nervous about it all along.

1390
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,000
But look at this now...
all still working perfectly.

1391
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,880
And it served me well.

1392
01:26:11,881 --> 01:26:13,759
It hasn't really done
anything wrong, this car,

1393
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,759
the only problems would have been
ones that I created.

1394
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,240
It's just remarkable.

1395
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,919
One tough little puppy.

1396
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,199
And it's torn its own face off
and been stitched back on.

1397
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,119
It's bruised, battered and scarred,
but it's joyful.

1398
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,519
Even now, battling itself to pieces,

1399
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,800
it's a happy noise.

1400
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,640
It's still willing.

1401
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,759
'The truth is that these three
fantastic cars have been better

1402
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,879
'ambassadors for Britain
than we could ever be.

1403
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,320
'And that gave us an idea.'

1404
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,400
This is the place. This is perfect.

1405
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,840
Well, this is it.

1406
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,359
Goodbye, Jag.

1407
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,760
You have been an absolute star
and I'm going to miss you.

1408
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,359
The Mini, the Jag and the Rolls
would be mounted on plinths here,

1409
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,600
high in the mountains by the road
connecting India and China...

1410
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,959
so that forevermore,

1411
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,439
people travelling between these two
great economic superpowers will be

1412
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,720
reminded that far away, there's
a small island called Britain...

1413
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,600
Great Britain.

1414
