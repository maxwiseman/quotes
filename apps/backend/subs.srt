1
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:23,510
Hello. Hello, everybody,
thank you very much. Thank you.

2
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,470
A big welcome! Nice.

3
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:30,670
A big welcome.
Thank you and welcome.

4
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,710
Welcome to what is
a very special show,

5
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:38,350
because it is our Christmas special.

6
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:41,110
Yeah, and this year
it's a little bit different.

7
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:44,590
Yeah, because it's actually
the middle of March. It is.

8
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:48,750
The main reason it's a little bit
different is because our producers

9
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,070
have told us that
we should try our hands
at long-distance lorry driving.

10
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,510
Literally, my idea of heaven. Yeah.

11
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,110
They told us each to buy a truck
and report with it

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:04,510
to what the BBC calls the Republic
of the Union of Myanmar.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,360
But everybody else calls it Burma.

14
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:20,550
The meeting point was
a giant parade ground

15
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,040
in the middle of
the old capital city, Rangoon.

16
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,920
And I was the first to arrive.

17
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:41,310
I've bought a stereo.

18
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,030
I have a speaker system here
in the roof,

19
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:47,910
the passenger seat has been replaced
with a subwoofer,

20
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:53,590
and there are two amps with
a combined power of 2,300 watts.

21
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,390
The best thing is,
included in the price was this comb

22
00:01:57,440 --> 00:02:01,680
and...an entire lorry.

23
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,710
It was built in 1959...

24
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,830
or 1976.
People are a bit hazy on that.

25
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,830
What we do know for sure
is that Isuzu made the mud flaps,

26
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:20,470
which is odd, because it says
Mitsubishi on the axles.

27
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,910
Ooh!

28
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,840
Is that James? It is James.

29
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
Don't really call that a lorry.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,510
Morning. Van, mate. What?

31
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,070
We had to bring lorries.
That is a lorry.

32
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,550
It's a van.
Technically it's a crane, actually.
I've bought a crane.

33
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,670
Oh, is that what that is?
Look at that.

34
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,990
A crane, two winches,
hydraulic rams, legs...

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,710
'And it had the latest
in high-tech dashboards.'

36
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,670
That's a mess.

37
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,190
Isn't this going to drive
your OCD madness...

38
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:03,110
Well, I've put labels
on things corresponding to
what I think they do.

39
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:05,870
Hazards... What's that?
I've got one of those.

40
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,230
I've had to put a question mark
on it. Mine is a sports lorry.

41
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:14,190
Straight six, rear-wheel drive,
twin exhausts.

42
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:18,590
BMW 325i and this, almost identical.

43
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,430
Banging stereo. Really?

44
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,270
Seriously. You want to hear it?
Not really. I expect it's quite...

45
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:39,070
Anyway, I'm sure that won't
become annoying at all.

46
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,470
I need to ask you a question. What?
Why are you wearing a tie?

47
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:44,030
Because I'm a modern lorry driver,

48
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,030
and modern lorry drivers
are crisp and sharp.

49
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,390
The days are over
when you simply turned up

50
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,240
with a glove box full of strong
pornography and egg on your vest.

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,830
At this point, Hammond arrived

52
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,710
with a glove box full of strong
pornography and egg on his vest.

53
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,390
What do you think?

54
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:06,390
What is it?
A lorry or a Hindu temple?

55
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,910
This has been extensively modded.
Has it?

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,710
Not just the visual improvements.

57
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,950
They are significant, the lights and
the little studdy things, but note...

58
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,590
Oh, God.

59
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:19,910
All of that frame arrangement,
right, it's a farm truck. Yeah.

60
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:23,310
And that's so it can accommodate
those low-density big loads.

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,230
Big loads of what? Crops.
What crop? Here? In Burma?

62
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,790
Home of the Golden Triangle?
Hay. No. Or turnips. No.

63
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,430
Kale. No, heroin.

64
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,750
That's all they really grow here.
You've bought a heroin lorry.

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:39,110
Fit a lot of heroine in there,
wouldn't you?

66
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:44,310
Hammond, this seat, well, let's be
honest, it's a church pew. Yeah.

67
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,110
It looks like the sort of railway
carriage that Agatha Christie
went about in.

68
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,870
James has bought a van.

69
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:52,760
Has he parked it a long way away,
or is it that small?

70
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,920
'As we were admiring
the paintwork on Jeremy's lorry,
our challenge arrived.'

71
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:06,990
I'm quite excited, actually, come to
think of it! We're here with these.

72
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:10,830
"In 1943, British, Australian
and Dutch prisoners of war

73
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,470
"were forced by their Japanese
captors to build the Burma Railway

74
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,230
"across South-East Asia.

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,910
"Their efforts and their suffering
were immortalised in the film

76
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,510
"Bridge On The River Kwai.
That's what you're going to do.

77
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,590
"You're going to build a river
bridge which is strong enough

78
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:30,830
"to support the weight
of your lorries."

79
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:34,310
I don't know anything about
bridge-building. Build a bridge?!

80
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:37,630
How big a bridge are we going to
have to build... Yeah, how big?

81
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,270
How much does yours weigh? About
1,000 tonnes. Afraid it gets worse.

82
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,550
You know they said long-distance
lorry driving? Yes.

83
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,950
"The only trouble is that you have
to drive to the river in question,

84
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,390
"which is in Thailand."

85
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:53,510
The River Kwai is not in Thailand.
Yes, it is.

86
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,110
The River Kwai is in Thailand.
Is it? Where's Thailand?
But it's in...

87
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,470
I promise you, the River Kwai,

88
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:01,230
I know everyone thinks it's Burma,
it isn't, it's Thailand.

89
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,950
So we're going to go and build
a bridge over the River Kwai.

90
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,030
Like Alec Guinness.
I don't know how to build a bridge.

91
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,040
'In high spirits,
the journey began.'

92
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,150
We are off.

93
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,560
Oh, yeah.

94
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:31,830
We worked out that the most sensible
way of getting to the river

95
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,670
was to head right across Burma

96
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,880
to its northernmost border crossing
with Thailand.

97
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:41,910
On this epic 1,200 mile journey,

98
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:45,990
we would find strange new cities
with no-one in them,

99
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:49,710
cross mountain ranges
straight out of Jurassic Park,

100
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:54,310
ford disease-filled rivers
and attend a party which made

101
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:58,400
the scene at the end of Apocalypse
Now look like a quiet night in.

102
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:01,870
And we'd have to do it all
in lorries which,

103
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:05,630
right at the start,
weren't really working properly.

104
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,990
There are gauges. Nothing works.

105
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:11,310
Nothing at all. Not one of them.

106
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,550
Not fuel gauge, oil,
oil pressure, charge, vacuum,

107
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:19,240
temperature, nothing works.

108
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,830
Oh, God above!

109
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,510
Ah! That's not it.

110
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,630
There's no synchromesh
on this gearbox,

111
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,470
so when you go from third to second
or whatever, you have to -

112
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,030
oh, bloody Nora - double de-clutch.

113
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,110
Like that. Only smoother.

114
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,040
Oh!

115
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:47,920
Oh, God.

116
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:52,560
How fast am I going?
Speedo doesn't work.

117
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,350
Oh, my giddy aunt!
The ride is shocking.

118
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,360
OG!

119
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:03,080
Possibly a bit of play
in the steering.

120
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,790
Let me talk you through my brakes.
They don't really work.

121
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:12,590
I've got three centimetres of
pedal travel where nothing happens,

122
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:16,560
and then a millimetre where it all
happens and the wheels lock up.

123
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:22,110
There's no handbrake,
and I'm not being stupid.
I've looked everywhere.

124
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,680
There isn't a puh-chh! one,
there isn't hand one,
there isn't a switch.

125
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:29,390
And on top of
the mechanical problems,

126
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:32,110
we had to deal with
Rangoon's pedestrians.

127
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,000
Stop wandering about in the road!

128
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:43,390
Whoa! A granddad's just walked
by that child, right underneath
your lorry.

129
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:45,400
Whoa! Somebody else just did it.

130
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:51,120
Pedestrians have no concept
of traffic. None at all.

131
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,560
And there was another issue.

132
00:08:55,640 --> 00:08:59,630
One of the reasons that driving
here is so difficult

133
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:04,470
is because everybody, as you can
see, has right-hand-drive cars,

134
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:06,840
but they drive on the right.

135
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:13,070
And this is because, for 46 years,
Burma was run by

136
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,840
a chap called General Ne Win,
who was a proper lunatic.

137
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,350
He was guided mostly either by
his dreams or by his astrologers.

138
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:28,910
One morning, he woke up
and he thought,

139
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:32,350
"My country is slipping too far
to the left politically,

140
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:35,790
"so I shall correct this
by forcing everybody

141
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:39,280
"to drive on the right-hand side
of the road."

142
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,430
This makes life particularly
difficult for bus passengers.

143
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:48,350
In a minute, we'll see a bus
pulled up at the side of the road,

144
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,870
at a bus stop, but all the people
will be getting out

145
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:54,950
into the road, because the bus used
to go on the left, so the doors...

146
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,160
It's just complete madness!

147
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,270
You may be wondering why today

148
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:05,840
people don't buy
left-hand-drive cars...

149
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,200
..and if I'm honest,
I'm wondering that as well.

150
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:16,000
Our worst problem, however,
was that James was navigating.

151
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:20,550
James, can I say,
this can't be right.

152
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,320
Sorry! Sorry!

153
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,920
How does James ever land his
aeroplane where he wants to be?

154
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,960
Right, should be this way.

155
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,840
'It wasn't.'
Will I even fit down there?

156
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,550
Mind that sign on your right,
Hammond. This is ridiculously tight!

157
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:54,270
'As I sorted out some compensation
for the damaged fruit...'

158
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:58,030
Thank you. No, no!
Oh, I see, it was not enough.

159
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,670
'..Hammond was discovering
for the very first time

160
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,670
'the problems of being tall.'

161
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,230
Hold on a second, these wires...
these are too low.

162
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:08,080
Oh, God.

163
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:13,790
I'm thinking if I crane out...
It's only this one, isn't it?

164
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,070
Yeah, lift that, you come
underneath, I'll drop it on you,

165
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,390
then it will just slide
along your rails.

166
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:25,030
Do it.
How about five crisp English pounds?

167
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,360
Keep coming. Keep coming.

168
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,470
Haven't been electrocuted yet.

169
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:40,360
Haven't been electrocuted yet.
Still haven't been electrocuted.

170
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,910
I don't like it!
Oh, everyone's going to die!

171
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:47,470
BANG!

172
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,990
You've ripped a hole
in the top of my truck!

173
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:54,790
James... Why is your...
Your lorry's moving, James!

174
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,710
You've winched yourself into...
Put your handbrake on.

175
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:01,390
It hasn't got a handbrake.
What do you mean,
it hasn't got a handbrake?

176
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,600
It hasn't got a handbrake!

177
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,000
'We were causing chaos.'

178
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:14,360
It's broken.

179
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:26,910
Whoa! What was that?!
James, I've got a headache!

180
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:29,640
I've never concentrated this hard!

181
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,080
Sorry. I don't think it will
go through there, mate.

182
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:42,000
Sorry. Sorry.

183
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:48,320
Still, the good news is
we've done two miles.

184
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,760
'Mercifully, we eventually broke
free from the narrow streets.'

185
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:00,270
I'm in agony. Left foot,
endless gear changing...

186
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,270
God above.

187
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,920
Reverse.

188
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:08,670
Third... Oh, Christ!

189
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,960
Hang on a minute.

190
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,590
If I engage the low range
then I can put it in third gear

191
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,760
and basically leave it there
all day.

192
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,510
A-ha! How brilliant is this?

193
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,950
Oh, yeah.

194
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,750
No more gear changing.

195
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,000
That doesn't feel
very low range to me.

196
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,520
What is it
if it isn't a low-range gearbox?

197
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,600
Oh, my God!

198
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:54,960
My truck has split in half.

199
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,230
'After I had explained to Jeremy
that he'd bought a tipper lorry,

CW McCall on the CB radio.'

201
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,110
Hey, James. Hello.

202
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,950
I've got it. You've got it?

203
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,710
Yeah, my handle.

204
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:18,720
I'm going to be called
Fighting Peacock.

205
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:24,190
Can I just abbreviate that to Cock?
What are you going to be?

206
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,830
I thought I'd be James,
because that's my name.

207
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
Fighting Peacock!

That's my first lock-up,
total lock-up.

I've lost second gear.

I'm sitting on a church pew,
for God's sake.

My knee... Ah!

238
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,190
Ow! Ow!

239
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:55,520
My knee! Ow!

240
00:16:57,640 --> 00:16:59,960
That is the going down of the sun.

241
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:03,960
It's fabulous. Look at that.

242
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,150
However, when the sun
had finished going down,

243
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:22,000
things weren't so fabulous.

244
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:31,240
That girl on that bike,
she's just invisible.

245
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,270
There's a moped there
with no lights on

246
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:37,390
and a bicycle there
with no lights on,

247
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,990
and I can't really see them,

248
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,760
because my headlights are, well,
they're glow-worms in jam jars.

249
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:46,960
Can you see anything, Hammond?

250
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,270
Not a thing.

251
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:53,560
Literally, just my own stupid
reflection in my windscreen.

252
00:17:56,960 --> 00:18:02,150
Jeez, I'm so frightened of
running over a pedestrian,

253
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:05,480
I'm not even worried
about my knee any more.

254
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,790
Whoa!

255
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,270
Well, if I had to dip
the headlights,

256
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:19,080
it would appear to be
full beam or off.

257
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:30,510
A lorry with one central headlamp,
so you think it's a motorbike

258
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:34,320
until the last second, and then, no!
It's a massive truck!

259
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:45,000
I'm bloody tired. I've been driving
today for exactly 12 hours.

260
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,800
That would be illegal in Britain.

261
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:53,000
But we are now very close
to the overnight hotel.

262
00:18:56,680 --> 00:19:00,120
'Two agonising hours later,
we reached it.'

263
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:18,360
Do you know what? This is like a
trucker's place. Are we staying here?

264
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:23,160
'The producers said yes,
and that our room was upstairs.'

265
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:28,600
Oh, it's not so bad!
Is it not so bad? Yeah.

266
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,240
Oh, God.

267
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:01,880
Worst night's sleep in history.
It wasn't sleep.

268
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,750
This lot. What were they doing?

269
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:10,710
That.

270
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:13,030
Look what I've done.

271
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:15,070
What have you done?

272
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,000
It's a leg brace so I can change
gear. So it supports my knee.

273
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,750
Let's go. Let's just move on,
erase it...

274
00:20:25,800 --> 00:20:28,350
You know those Ice Road Truckers,
they're always going,

275
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,230
"We got a real tough job..."
They can shut up.

276
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,070
Cos I don't suspect that
the Ice Road Truckers

277
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,230
have to sleep like this chap here.

278
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,360
Look at him.

279
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:46,120
'Before leaving, I checked the map
to see how far we'd come.'

280
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,160
No? Here? Are you sure?

281
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:55,520
Here.

282
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,360
Show me. Hammond.

283
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,040
This is where we began.

284
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:13,270
We're heading for here,
up here, around here.

285
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,990
So where do you think we are, then,
on this road?

286
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,790
No. We're here.

287
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:24,510
You know that fork when we left
Rangoon and James went left?

288
00:21:24,560 --> 00:21:31,430
All of yesterday we drove up here.
What was it, 14, 15 hours?

289
00:21:31,480 --> 00:21:33,520
Yeah, but... You're on
the way to Bangladesh.

290
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,310
'James suggested we go
all the way back to Rangoon

291
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:42,190
'and start again, but I fired him
as navigator and said

292
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,520
'we should take a small road over
the hills to get back on course.

293
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:53,000
'This would mean driving
deep into the sticks.'

294
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,470
There seems to be a tradition here
for riding on a lorry rather than

295
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,510
necessarily in it. I've just seen
three or four blokes

296
00:22:04,560 --> 00:22:08,230
on the top of the cab of a lorry.

297
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:10,750
So if he brakes suddenly,

298
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,480
they all get run over, I suppose.

299
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:18,590
'Still, could be worse.'

300
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,280
Uh!

301
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:29,510
I'm not a young man and I'm
not a fit man, I'll be honest.

302
00:22:29,560 --> 00:22:33,670
And I am suffering in here.
This ride is really brutal.

303
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:37,030
The problem is that the sports
lorry was designed

304
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,710
to work for a living,

305
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:42,510
was designed to have five or six
tonnes of stuff in the back.

306
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:47,160
Without that weight, it's just
bouncing all over the place.

307
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:51,630
'Obviously, I didn't want
to admit this to my colleagues,

308
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:57,360
'so when we stopped for tea I tried
discreetly to rectify the problem.'

309
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,470
He's putting bricks in his truck to
weigh it down to improve the ride.

310
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:12,920
I can see. He's going to need
a lot of bricks.

311
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,150
'Having come to the same conclusion,

312
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:20,000
'I decided to borrow
James's complicated crane.'

313
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,320
I can't stand watching this.

314
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:42,880
Right.

315
00:23:50,040 --> 00:23:54,680
What the hell's happening?
What have you done, you moron?

316
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,480
I think you've actually
caught your own lorry.

317
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,880
Stop! Help! My knee!

318
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,680
Save the day!

319
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:14,030
Oh, dear. Stop! Put it down!

320
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,710
You'll break the jib off the crane.
And you've knackered my lorry.

321
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:20,390
I've just saved the day
by tipping my lorry up.

322
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:23,910
The bricks have fallen out,
the handbrake's not on.

323
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,000
What have you done? It is on.

324
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:32,160
'At this point, I opted for
a less high-tech solution.

325
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:41,910
'And after they'd loaded a tonne
of bricks in the back,

326
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,120
'there was a noticeable difference.'

327
00:24:46,160 --> 00:24:49,600
It's not perfect,
but it's a hell of a lot better.

328
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,600
If I put more weight in,
it will be even more comfortable.

329
00:24:56,080 --> 00:25:00,720
'So at the next village, I bought
some of the region's special seeds.'

330
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:03,640
What's he doing?

331
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,510
He thinks he's bought some heroin.

332
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,070
I have. Has he?

333
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:13,910
I have bought heroin. It's rice.
It isn't rice. It is rice.

334
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:19,030
Richard Hammond, trust me on this,
on the streets of London,

335
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:21,600
this has a value of £12 million.

336
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:29,590
No, mate, on the shelves of Tesco,
that has a value of about a fiver.

337
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:32,600
It's not rice!
Are you going to cut it with peas?

338
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:39,870
'With the heroin loaded,

339
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,950
'I found a heavy old tree stump

340
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,800
'and asked James
to crane it on board as well.'

341
00:25:46,040 --> 00:25:48,320
He is so unbelievably happy.

342
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:56,510
'With the sports lorry fully loaded,
it was transformed.'

343
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,510
Oh, yeah!

344
00:25:58,560 --> 00:26:04,360
First bump, I shan't even feel it,
because the ride is sublime.

345
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:07,760
The ride of a Rolls-Royce Phantom.

346
00:26:09,680 --> 00:26:13,120
'However, on the hills,
there was a bit of a downside.'

347
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,790
Hello, James and Richard?

348
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,040
What?

349
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:22,750
This is my new top speed.

350
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:25,750
Oh, God, I thought we were
stuck behind a moped.

351
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:27,790
I couldn't see. Is this it?

352
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,590
Yes.

353
00:26:29,640 --> 00:26:31,800
You're a right dipstick.

354
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,600
Yes.

355
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:40,950
'And because the road was so narrow,
we couldn't get past him.'

356
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,440
Uh-oh!

357
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:45,560
Steep gradient.

358
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:49,960
Foot hard down.

359
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,270
Dearie me, we're in trouble here.

360
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:59,240
This is ridiculous!
We're hardly moving.

361
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:11,390
No, we've had it.
You're going to have to back up.

362
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,790
I need a run-up for this bit. What?
It won't go up this hill.

363
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:17,390
You're going to have to back up.

364
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:20,270
No, this hill has gone on
for about a mile through hairpins.

365
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:21,750
I'm not reversing back down.

366
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:26,950
James, could you explain
the situation to him?
I can't go forwards.

367
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,670
I can't back up either.

368
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,910
A, Hammond's in the way,
and B, I can't be bothered.

369
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:35,200
..There's round bends,
this people on bikes. No.

370
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,720
Well, there's only one thing for it,
then. I have to lose weight.

371
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,840
Oh, no.

372
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,080
No! Jeremy, that's not...

373
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,800
You are a complete child,
a petulant child.

374
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,710
You wanted me
to move out of your way.

375
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:15,680
I am now able
to move out of your way.

376
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:26,390
Look at this. Yes!

377
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:30,960
This lorry
is now scampering up these hills.

378
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,150
Right. Well...

379
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:43,800
One, two...

380
00:28:50,600 --> 00:28:54,430
'Stopping to mend my tailgate
allowed the others to catch up,

381
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,920
'and when they did,
they weren't in the best of moods.'

382
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,720
I've got a new handle for you on
the CB. It's called Selfish BLEEP.

383
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,550
'And things didn't improve
a few miles later

384
00:29:08,600 --> 00:29:12,520
'when the hill route I'd selected
went a bit wrong.'

385
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:20,390
Your road is sort of not a road,
is it? Let's be honest.

386
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,750
Clarkson, you are a...

387
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,280
It's not really a road here at all.
We've got a ford.

388
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:32,640
Here we go, into the water.

389
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,480
Lots of wheel spin, sliding badly.

390
00:29:44,280 --> 00:29:45,320
Oh, yes.

391
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:50,350
The sports lorry is clear,
it's through.

392
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,400
It's time for the smug face.

393
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:58,640
'Mr Slowly went next...in his van.'

394
00:30:06,560 --> 00:30:08,640
That's quite clunky.

395
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,990
It's... There's something stuck
there, I can feel it.

396
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:21,750
We'll break the front axle off.

397
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:24,750
'Hammond immediately rushed
to May's aid.'

398
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:26,280
Ramming.

399
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,040
Stop!

400
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,710
'James then tried
to winch himself off

401
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:35,280
'using Hammond's truck
as a ground anchor.'

402
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:40,920
Ted Nugent and George Michael
are helping one another out.

403
00:30:44,160 --> 00:30:47,590
'After this failed,
I tried to tow him clear.'

404
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:50,360
Three, two, one, now.

405
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,990
'But that didn't work either.'

406
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,950
Stop!

407
00:30:57,000 --> 00:31:01,160
'He then decided to use his crane,
which immediately broke.

408
00:31:05,720 --> 00:31:10,160
'He really was stuck, so we were
forced to take drastic action.'

409
00:31:12,560 --> 00:31:15,400
Hammond and I have had
a bit of a chat and we are...

410
00:31:16,520 --> 00:31:17,910
Well, we're leaving him.

411
00:31:17,960 --> 00:31:22,750
He has bought a van
that has no traction at all,

412
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:24,910
no ability to work off road

413
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,670
and now no hydraulics
so none of his tools work.

414
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,510
You've got to be ruthless
in these circumstances.

415
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,190
With his crane, he was useful.

416
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:35,760
Without it,
he's just another mouth to feed.

417
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,510
'I settled in for another stint
with the world's most
cooperative gearbox.'

418
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:46,750
Oh, bollocks, missed again.

419
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:48,550
Nothing there.

420
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:50,200
Nothing there, there it is.

421
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,800
'I knew, on these twisting roads,
life was even worse for Hammond.'

422
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,590
This is really annoying.

423
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:05,520
'Still, at least I was moving.'

424
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,070
The situation report.

425
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,950
I've been rescued by a very helpful
local man with his truck.

426
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,630
I still don't know his name.

427
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:17,190
He's lent me this arc welder

428
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,920
to repair the shaft that drives
the pump that makes the crane work.

429
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,430
'With that done, my fellow
knight of the road towed me

430
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,760
'back to firmer ground.'

431
00:32:31,240 --> 00:32:32,960
And then we're free.

432
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,480
I must remember to say a thousand
chei-zu-boos to this man.

433
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:45,870
'Miles ahead. in the advance party,
we were really starting to climb.'

434
00:32:45,920 --> 00:32:48,070
Oh-ho-ho!

435
00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,200
Wow!

436
00:32:52,280 --> 00:32:54,160
'The views were stunning.

437
00:32:56,400 --> 00:33:00,400
'And at the top of the hill,
we pulled over for a bit of a look.'

438
00:33:06,200 --> 00:33:09,510
You know we always say
that Italy is God's race track,

439
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:13,360
Canada is his pantry,
Germany is his workshop?

440
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:16,200
That's his garden.

441
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,840
Absolutely staggering.

442
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:26,320
'Captain Traction would have enjoyed
this view very much, however...'

443
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:35,600
Bollocks.

444
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:50,280
The local bloke with a digger is
giving me a little leg up there.

445
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:59,070
It's great, isn't it? This must be
Buddhism in action.

446
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,310
I might convert.

447
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,760
From whatever I already am.

448
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:09,230
'Very, very far ahead,
Hammond and I finally found the road

449
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:12,280
'we should have been on
in the first place.'

450
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:26,000
Put it in top gear.

451
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,950
There it is. Oh, yeah.

452
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,840
That sounds terrible.

453
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:37,960
It's like being back in Spain.
Nothing on it.

454
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,990
'Regrouped, we continued onwards.

455
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:49,400
'Our destination, Burma's brand-new
capital city, Naypyidaw.'

456
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:03,270
'Here, the producers had once again
lined up a hovel for us to stay in.

457
00:35:03,320 --> 00:35:06,750
'But we were hot, filthy
and worn out.

458
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:10,760
'So we ignored them and headed
for the best hotel in town.'

459
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:14,880
A flushing lavatory.

460
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:18,390
Oh, rest my weary head.

461
00:35:18,440 --> 00:35:21,240
Having first filled it with gin.

462
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,880
Oh, listen to that rain.

463
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:31,160
It'll be like the shower
or something. 30 seconds.

464
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:35,910
'Our only problem was that two of us

465
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:39,350
'weren't exactly dressed
for a place like this.'

466
00:35:39,400 --> 00:35:41,470
Let me do the talking.

467
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:43,710
Good evening, sir. Evening, sir.

468
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:46,390
Three rooms, please.

469
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,200
Sorry, no more rooms, sir.

470
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:54,320
Fully booked.

471
00:36:00,120 --> 00:36:01,640
Sorry, sir.

472
00:36:11,880 --> 00:36:14,910
'The next morning
after another dreadful night,

473
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:19,630
'we decided enough was enough and
agreed we should modify our lorries

474
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:24,040
'to make them more suitable
for our travels through Burma.

475
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,990
'So we found a workshop,
hired some local help,

476
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:31,590
'toiled through the night,

477
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:35,160
'and the next morning
the job was done.'

478
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:40,870
Every modification I have made

479
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:44,670
is inspired by my desire
not to run over any of the locals.

480
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:47,670
So it has, for example,
Buddha looking down,

481
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:50,590
a lucky elephant, the lucky owl
which is very important,

482
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,870
it has better mirrors,

483
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,030
better lights and it is wearing
a high visibility jacket.

484
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:58,030
Yes, as are you. What is
the boiler in the back? That...

485
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,390
Are you brewing beer?
What? No, sadly.

486
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,150
It's the water tank
for the brake cooling system.

487
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:06,070
What, like racing lorries have?
Exactly like that.

488
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,630
It sprays. I've got a little switch.

489
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:10,710
It sprays water on the drums,
makes them more efficient downhill.

490
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,830
I didn't think of that.
No. What's the box?

491
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:17,070
Air conditioning. What's that got to
do with safety? Keeps me alert.

492
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,390
Does it? Yes.
And keeps him alert as well.

493
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:21,280
Because he'll want to break it. Yes.

494
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:24,080
'Jeremy then showed us his work.'

495
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:35,270
Why would you not have a convertible
lorry. Cos it's raining. Look at it!

496
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:38,070
It's... It's quite good actually.
Smashing. It's very good.

497
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:41,510
Shelby striping.
Sports badging on the side.

498
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:43,070
Living accommodation on the back.

499
00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:46,070
This is fashioned from lead
and rhodium. Is it?

500
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,160
Yes, for extra weight
to improve my ride. Come back.

501
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:57,430
Simple, crisp accommodation inside,
Shelby bedding and ebony wood floor.

502
00:37:57,480 --> 00:38:00,520
More weight. Come on!
It looks brilliant.

503
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:04,990
'As, it must be said,
did Hammond's.'

504
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,350
Hammond, you've got white walls!
Oh, yeah, yeah!

505
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,950
The ugly duckling has become a swan.
Wow! Yeah!

506
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,270
Check out my stacks. Please don't
tell me they're exhausts.

507
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:16,950
Yeah. Both sides.

508
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:19,870
What, actually func...? They are.
Yeah, there's a T-junction.

509
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:23,910
Hang on, you've made it even taller.
I have. It's bigger, isn't it?

510
00:38:23,960 --> 00:38:27,270
It's better. But, come round
the back, this... Honestly.

511
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,910
He did a little skip then.
He's very excited. He did a skip.

512
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:36,390
I am very, very... What I have here,
this is the bathroom area. Shower.

513
00:38:36,440 --> 00:38:41,110
It's got a shower. Where's the water
come from? Ha-ha! Ha-ha yourself.

514
00:38:41,160 --> 00:38:44,270
There is, up the top, a reservoir.
About so big.

515
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:49,110
On my viewing gallery. Hammond, it's
a bucket. It's... It's a bucket.

516
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,030
It's a remote reservoir.

517
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,830
And that is, right now,

518
00:38:52,880 --> 00:38:56,510
collecting beautiful crisp, clean,
fresh, invigorating rainwater.

519
00:38:56,560 --> 00:38:59,230
This is the kitchen area with lino
to reflect that. What's that?

520
00:38:59,280 --> 00:39:00,590
Over there is a wardrobe.

521
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,110
There is a hammock with mosquito net
built-in. Drinks globe on the right.

522
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,270
'And Hammond wasn't finished.'

523
00:39:07,320 --> 00:39:10,910
From up here, on a sunny evening,
I can sit here as the sun goes down,

524
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,990
gaze at the stars and enjoy
a drink from my drinks globe.

525
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,230
Do you take visitors? Yeah.

526
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:19,190
I think he's going to have to
because something
has just occurred to me.

527
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,950
What? You haven't got
any living accommodation.

528
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,670
That's a very good point.
You've forgotten it, you idiot!

529
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,320
No, I haven't.

530
00:39:28,360 --> 00:39:30,990
Well, you have.
Are you sleeping in the cab?

531
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,390
Because it's not going to be
comparable. Let's... Let's see.

532
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:38,190
'Before we set off,
I gave the chaps some presents.'

533
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:41,750
You bought us a teddy bear?
No, that's for me. Is it?

534
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:44,990
Yeah, that's my bonnet ornament. Are
you feeling lonely? It's your what?

535
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:49,430
Bonnet ornament for weight. It's
the heaviest teddy bear in Burma.

536
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,200
'I'd got Hammond
a bonnet ornament too.'

537
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,750
Wow, that's beautiful.

538
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:58,430
I know you don't have a clock
so you'll have it on the bonnet,

539
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:01,270
you'll be able to tell the time.
Oh, it really is...

540
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:05,830
It's a high-quality gift.
Oh, fantastic! Thank you.

541
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,230
I've always wanted
a Shuanglin hammer.

542
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,560
It's from my own personal
collection.

543
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:19,080
'Having christened my bear Rudyard,
and attached him to
the sports lorry, we set off.'

544
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,870
Oh, this feels better already.

545
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,760
Oh, hang on.

546
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:31,280
Richard Hammond is doing
a remake of The Poseidon Adventure.

547
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:35,870
'We had many miles to cover

548
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:40,360
'but first we had to get through
Naypyidaw's morning rush hour.'

549
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,550
This rush hour traffic is
not as bad as I thought.

550
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:53,200
'The roads were completely empty.
And massive.'

551
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:12,920
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven, eight. Yep, 16 lanes now.

552
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,790
Wait, it's gone bigger.

553
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:22,590
Five, six, seven, eight,
nine, ten. 20.

554
00:41:22,640 --> 00:41:24,480
It's 20 lanes now.

555
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:30,360
'This may look stupid and pointless,
but actually it really isn't.'

556
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:34,550
The problem with most cities
is that the growth comes

557
00:41:34,600 --> 00:41:36,830
and the city simply
can't accommodate it.

558
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:40,590
That happened in London, Rome,
Paris, Bangkok, everywhere.

559
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,520
That is not going to happen here.

560
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:46,790
I think this must be
the first city built

561
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:49,760
entirely in anticipation
of the future.

562
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:55,480
'But the future hasn't arrived yet.

563
00:41:58,240 --> 00:42:02,200
'So, for now, the whole place is
almost completely deserted.

564
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,270
'Even here, in the shadow
of the parliament building,

565
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:14,270
'we were able to have a game of
football in the middle of the road.'

566
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:15,560
Officer.

567
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:22,830
It's the Burmese police versus Top
Gear. Oh, no. Rush hour, game over.

568
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:24,910
Look at it, traffic.

569
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:28,310
Really though,
it was too wet for football.

570
00:42:28,360 --> 00:42:33,150
So, much to Hammond's annoyance, we
organised a city centre drag race.

571
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:39,190
This doesn't seem fair.

572
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,030
I've got the same 6.4 litre Isuzu
straight-six diesel as Jeremy's

573
00:42:44,080 --> 00:42:48,960
and probably James's,
but the lumber bus is bigger.

574
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,880
We're not going to cover ourselves
in glory here, old girl.

575
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,680
Disastrous start. There it is!

576
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,080
This is going to hurt,
we're going to have to rev you hard.

577
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:18,150
Sports truck is gaining. Gaining.

578
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,630
Gaining. Gaining, gaining.

579
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,840
No!

580
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:29,480
115km an hour.

581
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:33,240
Come on! Yes!

582
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:40,000
Oh, victory is sweet.

583
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:45,190
Second place.
But I have got a crane.

584
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:46,880
Must brake, must brake.

585
00:43:48,760 --> 00:43:51,640
Oh, got a football under
the brake pedal. That's bad.

586
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,040
Hammond, have you finished yet?

587
00:43:59,960 --> 00:44:01,680
Still going.

588
00:44:03,360 --> 00:44:08,230
'After Hammond had lumbered across
the line, we headed out of Naypyidaw

589
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:12,680
'and soon we started to discover
some flaws with our modifications.'

590
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:19,640
Oh, my... No...no, wait.

591
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:26,240
I'm speaking to you now
from underneath
my businessman's umbrella.

592
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:30,750
It has taken the water
about 15 minutes to fathom it out

593
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:34,360
but it's in here now
and it's in in great quantities.

594
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:39,560
Oh, I can hear my exhaust
hitting a tree.

595
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:47,030
Hammond, you're doing the council
out of a job, mate.

596
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:51,430
It's like I'm driving through
the aftermath of a hurricane.

597
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,470
Let's rename him Pruning Peacock.

598
00:44:59,160 --> 00:45:02,880
'Soon, though,
James was punished for mocking.'

599
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:07,550
Captain Workmanship.

600
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:10,600
It's a radiator hose.
It's not a bit I've touched.

601
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:13,230
Well, we have a tradition.

602
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:17,030
Oh, no, how am I going to
do it without them(!)

603
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:20,390
'Leaving James to deliver
an interesting lecture...'

604
00:45:20,440 --> 00:45:22,910
If you're watching this
from an engineering workshop

605
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,550
or technical college, this is not
the correct tool for the job.

606
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,800
'..we continued on our way.'

607
00:45:40,120 --> 00:45:44,640
I think a lot of the fumes
are coming into the cab
from under my new stack.

608
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:50,640
Not all of my improvements
have turned out to be improvements.

609
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,830
The simple tradition of
the British dustman,

610
00:45:59,880 --> 00:46:02,830
putting a teddy bear
on the front of a lorry,

611
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,280
is bringing joy
to the children of Burma.

612
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:08,040
They love Rudyard!

613
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:16,590
'By mid-afternoon
we were all reunited

614
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,840
'and James took advantage
of my mobile maintenance service.'

615
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:25,630
This isn't perilous at all(!)

616
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,750
Oh, it's about
three or four inches.

617
00:46:28,800 --> 00:46:31,070
Too far.

618
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:38,910
'Soon, the road started to climb,
and as night fell,

619
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,520
'I turned on the roof lights
that I'd fitted myself.'

620
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,310
Oh, yes!

621
00:46:46,360 --> 00:46:49,710
MUSIC: "The Great Gig In The Sky"
by Pink Floyd

622
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,760
I'm driving a Pink Floyd gig
right now.

623
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:04,080
I love this!
The noise, the chaos, the heat...

624
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,630
I think I might have just lost
one of my...

625
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,320
Yeah, I did. I lost a stack.

626
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:17,350
I've got to carry on.

627
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:19,720
I'm just going to pretend I didn't.

628
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:27,270
'Meanwhile, in the darkness,
James was coming over all Buddhist.'

629
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:30,520
Hang on, I've got a personal
dog escort here.

630
00:47:32,840 --> 00:47:35,190
Shift your ass, dog.

631
00:47:36,440 --> 00:47:38,560
Oh, God, give me strength!

632
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:47,670
I think that dog
was inhabited by a benign spirit.

633
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:49,790
Seriously -
if that dog hadn't done that,

634
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:53,080
I'd have gone onto the bridge
and I'd have hit the bus.

635
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,990
'Sadly, Buddhist dog wasn't around
when five miles later,

636
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:01,560
'I had another breakdown.'

637
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,990
That's what came off. That's the
old one, which tore itself to shreds

638
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:10,910
and in the process, pulled the wire
out of the sender

639
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,950
for the temperature gauge,
so I don't have that any more.

640
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,360
This lorry is crap.

641
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,670
'Up ahead, Richard and I
were looking forward

642
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:23,360
'to a night in our new
on-board accommodation.

643
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:30,200
'But thanks to the British Empire,
we didn't need it.'

644
00:48:33,760 --> 00:48:35,710
'After a night here,

645
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:40,270
'4,000 feet up a mountain in a small
village in the middle of Burma,

646
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,230
'at this strangely odd
but comfortable Bournemouth hotel,

647
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:47,560
'we were feeling refreshed.

648
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,150
'And with Hammond leading,

649
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,640
''we were out of the village
in a mere couple of hours.'

650
00:48:55,000 --> 00:48:57,400
Hang on - whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa.

651
00:48:58,600 --> 00:49:00,670
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

652
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:01,870
Oh, God...

653
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:04,270
Go slowly. OK?

654
00:49:04,320 --> 00:49:06,510
Oh, thank you.

655
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,910
Keep going, hang on...

656
00:49:08,960 --> 00:49:12,510
Are we going to spend the whole day
tiptoeing under telephone wires?

657
00:49:12,560 --> 00:49:15,320
No, because you'll break down
eventually.

658
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,750
OK, there's going to be
a motorcyclist coming past you.

659
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:26,400
Check out his helmet.

660
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:30,240
That's quite a strong statement.

661
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:34,190
'After a quick map check,

662
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:37,560
'I decided we should take
a tempting-looking short cut.'

663
00:49:38,520 --> 00:49:40,680
Right, follow me.

664
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:43,720
'Which went well.'

665
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,080

00:49:51,200 --> 00:49:54,590
Any other adventures
lined up on your short cut, Jeremy?

667
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:56,680
Landslides, or avalanche...?

668
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:06,280
It's just a tropical mountain
shower. Gone in a jiffy.

669
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,640
Or maybe not.

670
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,120
No, this looks pretty terrible.

671
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:22,990
'Eventually, my scenic route
brought us to a remote settlement -

'that was very much...off the grid.'

673
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:33,720
Good thing is in this little town
there'll be no low wires.

674
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:38,280
'Instead,
there was something worse.'

675
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:41,230
Oh, no!

676
00:50:41,280 --> 00:50:43,600
Oh, no. Oh, this is bad.

677
00:50:45,160 --> 00:50:47,200
I'm stuck, I'm stuck.

678
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:52,320
Hang on, I'll park up
and come back on foot. Stand by.

679

chimney-related problems,

'And found some locals playing
something that was nearly football.'

682
00:51:05,880 --> 00:51:10,280
This is a brilliant idea.
They're using a monk as a referee.

683

OK.

687
00:51:34,280 --> 00:51:35,910
Move the entire sign.

688
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:39,400

There's thousands of them!

That's "Hurry up. It's heavy."
Oh, right. OK...

692
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,350
How we doing? James, I can't see.

693
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:17,470
Yeah...?

694
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,790
OK! Yes. You through?

695
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:22,040
Yay!

696
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:28,600

00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:38,750
My fuel gauge is...
just on the top of the red.

Um... I don't have one.

700
00:52:42,480 --> 00:52:44,870
What I do have is the same engine
as you

701
00:52:44,920 --> 00:52:48,160
but a much heavier truck,
so I must have used more.

702

What's the news?

713
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,710
None. I mean, it's dry,
I don't know what I'm running on.

714
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,230
If you actually run a diesel out

715
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,910
- you've got to bleed the system,
haven't you? And it's hours.
- Yeah.

716
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:33,870
Well, look, why don't you just go
and snout around the village
and see if you can find some?

717
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:35,750
Why me?
You're the youngest and fittest.

718
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:38,790
Well, it's your fault we're in
this situation. But I'm old and hot.

719
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:43,480
It's your short cut. Seriously. If
anybody's got to go, it's you, mate.

720
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,870
Right, right, I'll go.

721
00:53:46,920 --> 00:53:50,190
Fuel. Diesel.
And as much as you can. Yes.

722
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,950
What is Burmese for "diesel"?

723
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,590
How do you mime "diesel"?
Mime a lorry.

724
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:57,870
Brrr... And then do that.

725
00:53:57,920 --> 00:54:01,880
Right, so I'm a butler with
Parkinson's, and I've got a gun.

726

'And was gone for quite some time.'

728
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:12,120
Still quite hot, that.

729
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,870
Done the oil. Have you? Are you
reading Bridge On The River Kwai?

730
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:25,230
Yeah, he's just gone into the hut...
Bad news. What? Bad news. What?

731
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:27,920
I haven't been able to get
any diesel.

732
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,040
'However - I had come up
with a clever alternative.'

733
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:38,000
No, you halfwit.

734
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,270
There's no diesel in this village.

735
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:45,150
But there is diesel
in the next village.

736
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:49,470
So we use the horses
to ride to the next village,

737
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,550
get the diesel, bring it back
to the trucks.

738
00:54:51,600 --> 00:54:54,870
We're not in a Western.
I can't ride a horse. What?

739
00:54:54,920 --> 00:54:59,350
Well, I might have been pony
trekking when I was eight, but...
Well, it'll be in there, won't it?

740
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:03,280
Well, I wouldn't use that one there.
Holy moly!

741
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:09,470
Why do they have five legs in Burma?
Maybe so it can milk itself?

742
00:55:09,520 --> 00:55:14,950
Shall we spend all day looking
at a horse's willy, or shall we go?!

743
00:55:15,000 --> 00:55:16,150
Oh, it's gone wrong...

744
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,710
'Being the most experienced horseman,

Hello, horse.

749
00:55:28,160 --> 00:55:30,480
I shall call you Tesco.

750
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,160
Ready, steady, go.

751
00:55:37,560 --> 00:55:40,390
Well, I've bought a stalled horse.
It's going backwards.

752
00:55:40,440 --> 00:55:41,990
I've bought a reversing horse.

753
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:44,630
I think if we get moving,
yours might follow more readily.

754
00:55:44,680 --> 00:55:47,910
James, can you turn right
and go up there? Turn around.

755
00:55:47,960 --> 00:55:50,990
How do you make it turn around?
Anybody know how to start
a Burmese horse?

756
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:53,310
Go on, follow your mate.
Yes. Very good.

757
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:55,630
The controls are reversed... I'm off!

758
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:57,240
Oh, yeah.

759
00:55:59,160 --> 00:56:01,030
Yeah!

your one's bottom.

You go ahead.

Oh, stop that, please don't fight!

770
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,470
Walk on. I'll stop calling you Tesco
if you promise not to fight.

771
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:39,190
Go!

772
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:43,230
Walk. There you go.
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow...

Not much further now, James.

have hurt my testes.

Yep. Not bust. Nothing exciting.

803
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,630
So what is it you have to do,
basically steering...?

804
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:11,790
Yeah, be all right.
You just have to...

805
00:59:11,840 --> 00:59:14,310
Yeah. Still do that. Right.

806
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:16,630
And how was sleeping in your lorry?

807
00:59:16,680 --> 00:59:19,590
Um, not bad. What about yours?
Fine.

808
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:22,310
Where did James sleep in the end,
what's he done?

809
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:27,670
Oh, he's got some stupid high-tech
mountaineering tent on his crane.

810
00:59:27,720 --> 00:59:29,150
Why is it up there?

811
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:33,990
Well... You know his snoring?

812
00:59:34,040 --> 00:59:35,150
Yeah...

813
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:38,800
Quite loud. So I moved him
a bit further away.

00:59:44,640 --> 00:59:47,350
What? Funny.

817
00:59:47,400 --> 00:59:50,230
Very funny. Yes.
I don't like heights,

I don't like camping...
I don't like snoring.

I'm still staggered that
they put diesel in my truck.

01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:22,440
I mean, that's a generous gesture.
Assuming it IS diesel.

Oh, no.

825
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:35,160
Hammond... What's happened?
I've lost my other stack.

826
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,080
Well, as you know, we're not the
US Marines, we leave a man behind.

827
01:00:46,480 --> 01:00:47,870
Yeah, too hot.

828
01:00:47,920 --> 01:00:50,000
Er, right...

829
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:56,350
It's covered in ants...
Oh, it's an ants' nest!

830
01:00:56,400 --> 01:00:58,470
That's a mistake. Ow!

831
01:00:58,520 --> 01:01:00,520
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!

832
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:03,830
'This, then, looked like
it was going to be

833
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:07,230
'another day of calamities
and mishaps.

834
01:01:07,280 --> 01:01:10,670
'But actually, here,
in this part of Burma,

835
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,960
'we had to get properly serious.'

836
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:19,360
Today is a big day for us,
because we are headed for the Shan.

837
01:01:20,320 --> 01:01:22,910
Top Gear's been to a lot of
remote places over the years

838
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:26,350
but we've never been anywhere
quite like this.

839
01:01:26,400 --> 01:01:30,230
The Shan is to Burma
what Scotland is to Britain,

840
01:01:30,280 --> 01:01:33,550
it's a part of it,
and yet it's separate.

841
01:01:33,600 --> 01:01:36,470
We know there's been
a civil war in there,

842
01:01:36,520 --> 01:01:39,390
we understand there's
a cease-fire at the moment...

843
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:42,870
Only a handful of Westerners
have ever been there,

844
01:01:42,920 --> 01:01:47,470
and certainly, no TV show
has ever been allowed in.

845
01:01:47,520 --> 01:01:50,880
We are the first...ever.

846
01:01:58,960 --> 01:02:03,430
All of the people who've been
fighting are coming together tonight

847
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,440
to welcome us
here to the Shan State.

848
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:10,600
Who's got any whisky? Got any Scotch?

849
01:02:12,360 --> 01:02:16,400
BLEEP second gear failed
and now the engine has BLEEP.

850
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:21,560
Hammond, you idiot! You've reversed
into the sports lorry!

851
01:02:24,160 --> 01:02:27,910
"Work on the bridge starts at 0500"?
What?

852
01:02:27,960 --> 01:02:30,000
Get in! Get in.
