00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,179
Hello and welcome
to a Top Gear special.

3
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:28,599
You join us in Downing Street
for a very good reason.

4
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:31,279
You see, shortly after coming
into power, Mr Cameron

5
00:00:31,280 --> 00:00:33,879
noticed that Britain was,
in essence, bankrupt,

6
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,719
and that to solve the problem

7
00:00:35,720 --> 00:00:38,559
we needed to do
more business with India.

8
00:00:38,560 --> 00:00:42,159
He has a point, because it turns out
we sell more to Ireland,

9
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,199
that has a population of 4.5 million
than we do to India,

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,679
that has a population
of 1,000 million.

11
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,799
It's actually even worse
than that.

12
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:53,599
It turns out that we sell even less
to India than the Belgians do.

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,639
So, we contacted Downing Street
and offered to go over to India

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:00,639
and run a trade mission
on the nation's behalf.

15
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,439
I have here a personal letter reply
to us from David Cameron himself.

16
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,879
"Dear Top Gear,
thank you for your letter.

17
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,039
"Whilst it's true I'm keen on us
to build on our ties out there,

18
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:16,159
"sending you three is not quite
what I had in mind.

19
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,120
"The Foreign Secretary
did wonder instead

20
00:01:18,121 --> 00:01:20,079
about a fencemending
trip to Mexico."

21
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,479
"Basically, my message is this..."

22
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,919
"you do the cars,
we'll do the diplomacy."

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
Oh, here he comes now.

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:34,760
Stay away from India.

25
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,679
Well, that was unequivocal.

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:41,399
Well, we're going to ignore
the Prime Minister.

27
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,599
What we're going to do instead is
to buy three second-hand British

28
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:47,959
cars, and then to head over there
with a very simple objective...

29
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,120
to rescue Britain.

30
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,799
'The start point
for our trade mission was Bombay.

31
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,279
CAR HORNS BLARE

32
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,280
'A vibrant, teeming mass
of 20 million potential customers.'

33
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,759
I am the first to arrive,
and as you possibly wouldn't expect

34
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,479
I don't appear to have
done this quite right.

35
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,399
This is a Series-1 Rolls-Royce
Silver Shadow from 1976.

36
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,599
Some of you will be saying, "You should
have brought a modern Rolls-Royce."

37
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:32,199
There's two reasons why I couldn't...

38
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,719
firstly, I had a budget
of just ã7,000.

39
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:38,679
Secondly, a modern Rolls-Royce
is of course a German car,

40
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,599
whereas this one was hand-wrought
in Crewe in a factory that used

41
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:45,559
to make Merlin engines
for Spitfires out of the finest

42
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:56,599
'At this point Jeremy arrived... '
Behold.

43
00:02:56,600 --> 00:03:00,479
'..in easily the most inappropriate
car it is possible to imagine.'

44
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,999
You stupid man.
What's wrong with it?

45
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,639
We're here representing Britain,
and all that's great about Britain,

46
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,239
and you have brought along
a Jaguar XJS,

47
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:13,999
almost certainly our country's
most historically unreliable car.

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,639
This is the celebration model.

49
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,999
Is it a celebration of production
finally coming to end?

50
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,919
60 years of Jaguar.

51
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,879
Special wheels,
special colour-coordinated bumpers,

52
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,359
four-litre, straight six engine.

53
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,959
That thing has a reputation
for stopping.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,880
James, as I recall
the braking system

55
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:36,079
and steering is controlled
by hydraulics. That is right.

56
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,439
Now, if this car were to break
down in the Rolls-Royce factory,

57
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:43,159
next to the team that built it,
they wouldn't be able to mend it.

58
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,999
You're in India. Yes. If your
hydraulics go wrong, you are out.

59
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,920
You are an embarrassment
to the nation.

60
00:03:48,921 --> 00:03:51,159
And can I just say, this vinyl roof,

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:53,399
he's just put the final
over the guttering.

62
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,519
This is not an advertisement.

63
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:58,519
If you were advertising
Millets' tenting...

64
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:02,599
This car helped cement the very
special Anglo-Indian relationship.

65
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:05,519
How? The favoured car
of the maharajas.

66
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,919
They sold hundreds of cars to India.
Only because Jaguar wasn't around.

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,799
All of the maharajas would have had
XJSs. They wouldn't. They would!

68
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:16,959
'At this point, something
very small arrived... ' Ha ha!

69
00:04:16,960 --> 00:04:17,760
'..in a Mini!'

70
00:04:17,761 --> 00:04:20,359
Oh, God, that's an absolute beauty.

71
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,239
That's quite a good idea, actually,
but don't tell him.

72
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:26,599
Hammond, you idiot. You idiot.
What?! Is that a good idea, is it?

73
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:28,359
Is it a good idea? It's genius.

74
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:31,879
Just to clarify what this is,
it's a classic Mini Cooper Sport.

75
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:34,680
One of the very last ones
built, in fact.

76
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,719
Year 2000. That is immaculate.

77
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,879
That is pretty tidy. It really is.

78
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:42,879
This is India, though.
It's a big old place,

79
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,319
and this is a small old car.

80
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,079
Come on, lads, you both know it is
the home of the small car. Was.

81
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:52,079
No, it still is. What matters most
in India is how big it is inside,

82
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,519
how small it is outside, and how many
people it carries. That's racist.

83
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,239
What?! When India was emerging,

84
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,679
they saw the car as a tool,

85
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,839
but now that India HAS emerged,

86
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:05,119
and is one
of the economic superpowers,

87
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,839
everybody is going to want something
with a great, long thrusting...

88
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,319
No, what happens next
is the country grows out

89
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:14,639
of the great, long thrusting,
and they come back to wanting,

90
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:17,999
yes, style, and practicality,
and convenience...? Look at it!

91
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,119
Yes, but we are trying to say
that Britain is a great country,

92
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,279
and has things to offer
to a country which has succeeded.

93
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:28,439
Such as this... No! ..not a tired old
Jaguar, and that's a Shadow? It is.

94
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,879
How far do you think
he's going to get in that?

95
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,959
Well, I think he's probably finished,
isn't he? That's it.

96
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,199
Let's see. 'Hammond and May
then ganged up on my Jag.'

97
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,199
I should point out the bits that
will go wrong. Yes. All of those.

98
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,279
Yeah, yeah, yeah. See all of those
relays and those connectors?

99
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,639
Made in the Midlands, they will go
wrong. Cooling system will go wrong.

100
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:50,960
It's OK, some of the relays
are made in Spain.

101
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:57,199
'We'd find out soon enough
if we'd made the right choices,

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,159
'because ahead lay
a 1,300-mile journey

103
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,999
'on some of the most dangerous
roads in the world.

104
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,560
'And then up into the brutal
high passes of the Himalayas.

105
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:15,279
'But first,
we had to get to know our cars

106
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:18,519
'on the streets of Bombay.'

107
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:21,999
HE GIGGLES This is the
perfect car for this place!

108
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,439
It is a puppy, yes, but it's
a Staffordshire bull terrier.

109
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,399
It is a... (MAKES BARKING NOISE)
A tough little puppy.

110
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,519
I've forgotten the way
these things deliver their power,

111
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,559
it's such a chunky little engine.

112
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,280
Oow! Yeah, speed humps,
how I miss you(!)

113
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:42,320
A man taking his washing machine
for a walk!

114
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,160
Morning.

115
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,119
Whenever we do these
long journeys on Top Gear,

116
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,799
there's always a sense,
the moment I set off,

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,599
that the car is already on its last
legs, but in this, there isn't.

118
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:03,079
All the dials are reading
what they should be reading,

119
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:06,840
the engine is smooth, the gear-change
is smooth, all the electrics work.

120
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:12,399
This is a mobile advertisement
for Great Britain.

121
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:15,919
Never mind that Jag today is Indian,
let's gloss over that.

122
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:17,759
HORN BLARES

123
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:22,759
210 horsepower... what Rolls...Royce
would have called "adequate."

124
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,959
It is adequate, more than adequate.

125
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:27,319
BUZZER SOUNDS

126
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,679
That's a buzzer that will sound
if it overheats, say,

127
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,959
or the hydraulic brakes fail. Let's
check that it works. You see?

128
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
BUZZER SOUNDS

129
00:07:39,040 --> 00:07:42,399
I love India,
I love the dynamism of it all.

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,199
People are busy. Business, business,
business. Get on, get rich.

131
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,360
Jag!

132
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,999
Look at that! Hammond's Mini.

133
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,480
He is a man in love!

134
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,439
MAKES GRUNTING NOISES
AT GEAR CHANGES

135
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,759
Weirdly, I have never
actually owned a Mini.

136
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,519
My brother had one, my best friend
had one, my girlfriend had one,

137
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:09,159
which I blew up
while she was on holiday.

138
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,959
I changed the engine in it,

139
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:13,759
and I bought one for 25 quid
and fitted it over a weekend

140
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,159
and never told her.

141
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:19,039
Until just then, when I told her,
then. Sorry about your car...

142
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,080
Mel.

143
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,199
I know Hammond hasn't got it,
so it's pointless asking,

144
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:26,919
but is your conditioning working?

145
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,199
Er, not as such. No.

146
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,319
'No, neither is mine.'

147
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:33,759
I thought it was,
for a brief, glorious moment,

148
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,600
but then I realised, no, it isn't.

149
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,879
What I was saying then
about my air conditioning

150
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,599
isn't actually true,
it's working an absolute treat,

151
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,599
but I don't want to tell them that
because they will just try

152
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,159
and break it in the night, because
they're resentful and peevish.

153
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,919
Guys, you know the producers
always provide a backup car

154
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,919
'on these shoots, in case
one of our cars go wrong?'

155
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:59,079
Yes.

156
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,319
'Have you seen what's coming
up in the middle lane

157
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,120
'on British plates right now?'

158
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,039
I've just seen it. I think
I've seen it, is it an Allegro?

159
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,679
It is.

160
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,639
Oh, you're joking!

161
00:09:13,640 --> 00:09:17,479
'Spurred on by this
terrible development,

162
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,719
'we decided to begin
our vital trade mission,

00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,800
'starting with one of Bombay's
most famous institutions.'

164
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,559
Everyday an army of about
5,000 people called dabbawalas

165
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,879
travel around the outskirts
of the city

166
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,279
collecting lunches in tins,
like these ones here.

167
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,279
They've been made by the wives
of working men, and from here

168
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:39,159
they are transported on foot,

169
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:42,640
or by bicycle
to the nearest train station.

170
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:48,319
Each tin is marked
with a system of symbols

171
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,319
that tells the dabbawalas
on the train where it's going.

172
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:55,200
So they know which tins have to be
unloaded at which station.

173
00:09:59,880 --> 00:10:03,399
The tins are then picked up
at city centre stations

174
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,079
by yet more dabbawalas,

175
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:08,399
who bring them to the menfolk
in their offices.

176
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:11,479
And the cost of having a piping hot,

177
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:16,200
home-cooked lunch, delivered
every day, is ã2 a month.

178
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:20,279
'What makes the whole system
really incredible

179
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:24,279
'is that 200,000 lunches
are delivered every day.

180
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:28,399
'Even though there's no FedEx-style
computerised tracking system,

181
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:33,319
'only one mistake is made
for every six million deliveries.

182
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:38,280
'That works out at an accuracy
level of 99.9996%.'

183
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,599
I think, however,
we could do better.

184
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,559
How can we do better than that?! If
you think about it, they use trains,

185
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,879
what if we used our cars?
That's not a bad idea, actually.

186
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,199
The first dabbawalas bring it to the
car park at the railway station.

187
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,839
Instead of putting it on the
train, we'll take it in our cars.

188
00:11:00,840 --> 00:11:02,559
We'll beat the train.

189
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,600
If you think, when
you're at home and you

190
00:11:04,601 --> 00:11:06,639
order a takeout pizza,
do they use the train?

191
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,039
They use a moped or a car. They are
hamstrung by tradition. They are.

192
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:14,799
"For 120 years, we've always used
to train. We always use the train."

193
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,200
This is where we can help.
Then it will be

194
00:11:17,201 --> 00:11:19,599
remembered the day the
dabbawala system was updated,

195
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,719
it was in a British car.
Exactly! Three British cars.

196
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:24,399
We're about to plug that gap.

197
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:28,720
That 0.0004% gap.

198
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:33,359
'And, so, the next day
our experiment began.

199
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,079
'We would load the meals
into our cars at Andheri station,

200
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:40,719
'in the suburbs, and then race
the train-bound dabbawalas

201
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:45,640
'to the finish line at Churchgate
station in the city centre.'

202
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:51,399
'Our train rivals prepared for
the challenge with quiet efficiency

203
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:54,360
'whereas in the car park,
things were rather less calm.'

204
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,719
13, right, 13s are there.
It doesn't matter if it says 13.

205
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,439
It does... it's people's lunches!

206
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:04,279
All we have to do
is get them to the other end.

207
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,879
In the right order!
No, James, please just bung them in.

208
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:11,260
Don't, because we'll just
be having a race with the

209
00:12:11,261 --> 00:12:13,639
train, which we could do anyway.
Bung, bung...

210
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,600
The point is to beat the
train AND make it work.

211
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:17,559
Bung yours in. Stop interfering!

212
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,999
I'm not interested in your view
on this. Go and do yours.

213
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:24,959
There's a train! There's a train.
Just load up now.

214
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:26,200
I've lost count now.

215
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,080
This is hacking me off!
If they're not in the right

216
00:12:34,081 --> 00:12:36,719
order we can't claim to
have beaten the system.

217
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,640
Just stop fretting about that and
load it up! Right! No time to lose.

218
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,359

220
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:48,960
Oh, for God's sake!

221
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,079
The 12s and the odds... What?
He's gone.

222
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:55,519
How many has he taken? About 12.

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:59,280
You are kidding? In total? Yeah.
What a moron.

224
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,959
'The train and I left the station
at exactly the same moment.'

226
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:10,159
Over the years, I have raced
a Japanese bullet train,

227

the Swiss railway network,

228
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,199
the French railway network
and never lost.

229
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,720
I don't intend to lose now!

230
00:13:19,560 --> 00:13:21,439
Coming through, coming through.

00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:34,679

lowered suspension even lower still.

Come on, man.

237
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,919
Here are the figures...
the train has got a 14...mile journey

238
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:46,319
and is scheduled to take 44 minutes.

239
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,919
My journey is 17 miles.

240
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:53,600
17 miles, 44 minutes,
that means I must average...

241
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,799
Green, 18. Green, green,
green, then yellow.

242
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:06,060
HORNS BLARE Come on,
lunches, in a hurry.

243
00:14:06,061 --> 00:14:08,320
People's lunches,
coming through.

244
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:16,280
I'm fine for tea towels, thank you.
No, thank you. Thank you, no.

245
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:22,719
17 miles, 60 miles an hour. No...

246
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:26,080
If it was an hour, about...

247

'By this stage, Captain OCD
had finally joined the race.'

248
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:36,039
Correct use of the horn there to
warn of your presence going past.

249
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:38,360
I'm going to try and
go to the outskirts of

250
00:14:38,361 --> 00:14:40,679
the city slyly and do
a ring-road approach.

251
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:44,520
I think that'll be quicker. It's
a bit further, but it'll be quicker.

252
00:14:46,640 --> 00:14:48,279
Oh, for crying out loud!

253
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:51,679
The one bit of open road
and look what I've got behind me...

254
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,919
Bombay 5-0.

255
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,799
Hello, officer. Hello, officer,
doing the speed limit.

256
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:02,120
That has got the hallmarks
of a massive thunderstorm.

257
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,039
As the train sped along,
my journey, thanks to Jeremy,

258
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,400
continued to be nerve wracking
and unpleasant.

259
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:14,080
Oh! I heard the food move.

260
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,719
Ah! My tins are rattling.

261
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,800
Ow!

262
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:27,159
This is just too easy,
I'm making cracking progress.

263
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,199
Test. It's fine.
BUZZER SOUNDS

264
00:15:30,200 --> 00:15:32,200
TYRES SCREECH

265
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,599
Yes, it's raining.

266
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,719
THUNDER SOUNDS

267
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,400
Bloody hell!

268
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:43,159
This is a big rainstorm now.

a few moments but, as in any city,

I now have 17 minutes
to revolutionise dabbawaling

272

and mend Britain's balance
of payments' deficit.

lunch on the way.

Come on!

sovereign nation of Great Britain.

276
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:14,199
On a mission...

277
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:19,159
Right, this is not good, it's clear
here. I'm going to go this way.

278
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,480
LOUD CLATTER

279
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:27,120
Oh!

280
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,720
14 minutes to go.
Come on, come on, come on.

281
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:38,960
We may have bitten off more than we can
chew, in this traffic. We may have done.

282
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:50,960
I'm pretty sure this right is right.
HORNS BLARE

283

Yes, most of that will go in there.

You see.

285
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,599
OK, there will be shouting from those
people who don't get their lunch.

286
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:08,920

There it is, there it is!

Come o-o-o-n!

296
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:51,839

must be quite a big ring.

297

This doesn't look very teeming
20-million-inhabitant- Indian-city-ish.

298

'In just over 43 minutes,
I arrived at the station.'

I've beaten the others,
but more importantly...

303
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,799
I've beaten the train.

304
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,519
'This was good news for Britain.'

305
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,200
What do you think of that, chaps?

306

Yes, now, listen...

but MUCH hotter than usual.

in that whole exercise?

00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:41,279
Having achieved an accuracy rating
in our delivery service of just 4%,

327
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:46,119
we decided to abandon dabbawaling
and head north to Jaipur.

328
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:51,720
But instead of driving, the producer
insisted we take an overnight train.

329
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:06,360
They CANNOT be serious!
That is not a motor rail carriage.

330
00:20:11,560 --> 00:20:16,079
How do you lose Bombay? I didn't
lose it so much, I overshot. What?

331
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:19,559
You can't miss it... it's enormous!
I tried to do a clever ring road.

332
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,759
It's the biggest place
we've ever been.

333
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,159
Why do you think the producer is
making us go on the train to Jaipur?

334
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:28,479
I don't know.
Why wouldn't he make us drive?

335
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:32,359
I was quite happy in my Rolls-Royce.
I was... There's nothing...

336
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:36,079
It's a slightly dangerous road,
but... It's a bit unexpected.

337
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,999
I think I know why. Why?

338
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:39,519
A-hem...

339
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,580
Because HE doesn't want to drive.
Oh, yes!

340
00:20:41,581 --> 00:20:43,639
The producer drives the Allegro.

341
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:46,399
He doesn't want to drive
in the back-up car.

342
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,279
It overheats, so you have
to have the heater on full.

343
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
Yeah.
I wouldn't want to drive that. No.

344
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,880
Having loaded our cars, we went
to get our tickets. However...

345
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:08,519
The queue goes all the way in there.

346
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,480
I can't do queuing. Really? I can't.

347
00:21:10,481 --> 00:21:14,639
Manual labour and queuing are the
only two things in life I can't do.

348
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,879
But I really physically can't.
No, I can't either.

349
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:20,359
I do this queue sweary thing.

350
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,639
I can go for so long and then (BLEEP)
it just happens. Did it happen then?

351
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:28,239
I can't... Ha, ha haaa! It's happened
again. Right, off you go, then.

352
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,999
So you don't mind...
because he doesn't like... Go.

353
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,400
Are you sure you don't mind?

354
00:21:32,401 --> 00:21:35,839
He doesn't like us, that's what's
going on. You may have a point. Go.

355
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,119
You absolutely...
He doesn't mind queuing!

356
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:41,039
I do, but I'd rather queue than
listen to you two bleating.

357
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:44,239
Arse! That was a gentle one,
but it gets a lot worse.

358
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:46,719
I'll take him for a beer.
I'll look after him.

359
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,840
Beer helps. That'll fix it.

360
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,400
As James inched forward...

361
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:05,639
I went shopping and then
met up with Hammond for lunch.

362
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:09,320
Would you like... chicken lung soup?

363
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,639
No. No.

364
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,999
Little bit of lung?
No. You won't even taste it?

365
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,999
No, I'm really not hungry. I'm fine.

366
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,799
Would you like me to give you
the present I've bought you?

367
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,959
Ooh, let me guess,
is it something impractical,

368
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:26,439
a bit ridiculous
and too big for the boot of a Mini?

369
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:29,759
Always so ungrateful. Honestly!

370
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:34,080
TANNOY: May I have your attention...

371
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:38,160
Hammond!

372
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:45,879
That's a double bass.
You like double basses.

373
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,719
I do like double basses very much.
Is that for me, seriously? Yep.

374
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:53,920
Thank you very much.
You're very kind.

375
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,719
I've had an idea.
You know when we get to Delhi? Yeah.

376
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,959
Why don't we have... cos this is what
most trade missions would do...

377
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:11,319
a party?

378
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:13,959
What, just, let's have a party?
If you have a party,

379
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:16,540
and invite the sort of
great and the good,

380
00:23:16,541 --> 00:23:19,119
Indian commerce people,
ambassadors...

381
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:21,900
Oh, like a sort of
ambassadorial, Ferrero

382
00:23:21,901 --> 00:23:24,680
Rocher type thing? Exactly that.

383
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,920
Hello. Three adults
for Jaipur, please.

384
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:53,639
Where would it be? Is it in a...?
What's it in? In a garden.

385
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:58,239
We could have a marquee. A garden
party! That's very British.

386
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,319
Come on!
This is actually a good idea.

387
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,239
It needs a focus, we're going
to have all British products

388
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:07,439
and our cars, and you walk around
and look at them and stuff.

389
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,560
But it needs a... What?
You need to...

390
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:16,359
What, you think we get
the Top Gear band back together?

391
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:20,760
What, so we entertain? I'm up for
that, I reckon that'll work. Cheers!

392
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:28,759
Many hours of queuing later,
Eeyore joined us on the platform.

393
00:24:28,760 --> 00:24:32,799
What's this? We're getting the Top
Gear band back together! Yes, we are!

394
00:24:32,800 --> 00:24:36,399
Come on. Yeah, we are.
Can you grab your keyboard?

395
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:37,959
I'll explain on the train.

396
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,359

397
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,479

'However, at the next station, James
insisted on doing some repairs.'

489
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:18,759
James, leave it. You haven't done it
properly. Leave it. It on, it's on.

490
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:22,559
TRAIN TOOTS
Whoa, my God!

491
00:30:22,560 --> 00:30:24,160
Run! Run!

492
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,640
Quick, get on, get on.

493
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,719
James, run. Pull the cord. Run!

494
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,159
Pull the cord! Pull the cord!

495
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:37,040
No, there's a...

496
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:44,919
Hammond. Yeah? To stop the train
you pull the chain. Yeah.

497
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:47,359
But there's a fine of 1,000 rupees.

498
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:50,799
That's about 13 quid. ã13. I mean...

499
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,839
I haven't got that sort of money.

500
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,440
I'm not paying 13 quid. No, no, no.

501
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:03,039
'Eventually,
we arrived at our stop, Jaipur,

502
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:06,160
'a town seemingly famous
for its natural springs.'

503
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,940
'We paused for a while
to wish our banners

504
00:31:10,941 --> 00:31:12,840
well on their journey
across India.'

505
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:17,559
That is a proud moment.
Isn't it? It is.

506
00:31:17,560 --> 00:31:20,799
I just wish James was here to see...
Our message.

507
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,240
Our message to the subcontinent.

508
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,600
Oh, God.

509
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,440
Oh. It's going to Delhi.

510
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,080
What's it going to say
on the other side?

511
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,039
'To make matters worse,

512
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:54,999
'it looked like Jeremy's
dabbawalla delivery in Bombay

513
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:57,160
'hadn't gone that well after all.'

514
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:01,559
'Then, when we unloaded
James's Rolls,

515
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,639
'we discovered we'd been betrayed.'

516
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,320
When you get in here,
you're in for a nasty surprise.

517
00:32:09,080 --> 00:32:10,799
Er, feel that.

518
00:32:10,800 --> 00:32:13,359
But there's cool air. Yes.

519
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,639
Yes, yes.

520
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:17,559
Devious...

521
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,999
He told us it was broken. Is it?

522
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,879
Oh! The thing is, though,

523
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,159
you know Gandhi?
Er, yeah, was he a Rolls man? No.

524
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,359
Absolutely not.

525
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:31,479
Now, Gandhi argued
there was too big a gulf

526
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:35,119
in India between the rich and
the poor and it should be narrower.

527
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:40,359
And I think if we disabled
James's air conditioning,

528
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:43,239
it would make him more equal to us.

529
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:46,719
And that's good not just for us,

530
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:50,440
but also spiritually for him.
Exactly.

531
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:55,840
Gandhi would approve of what I'm
doing now. This is a noble act. Oh.

532
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:01,639
Nothing to see here.
Nothing to see here.

533
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:03,679
Beautiful British engineering.

534
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:06,119
If we do it back up again,
there's no evidence.

535
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:10,199
No, none. It's the perfect crime.
It IS the perfect crime.

536
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,879
No tools...

537
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,960
no murder weapon. No.

538
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:18,759
'Eventually, Judas arrived.'

539
00:33:18,760 --> 00:33:21,199
May! You've made it.

540
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,959
Well done. How did you miss it?

541
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,920
What you couldn't see from the train

542
00:33:25,921 --> 00:33:29,199
was the platform ended and there was
a drop of 15ft. I did see that.

543
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:31,460
I couldn't do anything.
That's why I shouted, "Pull the cord.

544
00:33:31,461 --> 00:33:33,719
" Why didn't you?
There's a fine.

545
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:36,999
13 quid. But the good news is,

546
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:40,919
the cars have all arrived,
amazingly, in one piece.

547
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,839
Is it nice to see them?
I've also had a really good idea

548
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:46,720
for what we can do
while we're in Jaipur.

549
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,020
'My plan was to promote
the British motorsport

550
00:33:52,021 --> 00:33:54,679
industry by staging a
hill-climb event.'

551
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:58,200
'Which, of course,
meant finding a hill.'

552
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:02,839
Oh, yes!

553
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:06,680
Nice little course,
one kilometre. Perfect.

554
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,780
And what we've done
is invited some local

555
00:34:10,781 --> 00:34:13,599
Indians to bring whatever
vehicles they have

556
00:34:13,600 --> 00:34:15,480
to see how fast
they can get up the hill.

557
00:34:15,481 --> 00:34:17,280
It should be a good day's sport.

558
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,780
'But, of course, not only
would the Indians get a

559
00:34:20,781 --> 00:34:23,279
flavour of this traditional
British motorsport,

560
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:26,279
'we'd have a chance to see
what sort of vehicles are favoured

561
00:34:26,280 --> 00:34:28,400
'by the Indian petrol head.'

562
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,719
Go! Yeah! He's off.

563
00:34:31,720 --> 00:34:34,640
He's away! We're underway!
We've done something.

564
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:40,719
What was that motorcycle?
Because this is our leaderboard.

565
00:34:40,720 --> 00:34:43,479
That was the Rajdoot 175.

566
00:34:43,480 --> 00:34:45,759
'Moments later,
we got out first time.'

567
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,760
One minute, 20.6. Is that fast?
We don't know.

568
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:52,559
'Next up was
the Hindustan Ambassador,

569
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:54,839

in Calcutta 63 years later.'

571
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:01,959
Go!

572
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:05,079
Has he gone? He's still going.
Whoa! Still going.

573
00:35:05,080 --> 00:35:07,039
Whoa!

574
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:09,160
That's the smell
of Britain in the '50s.

575
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,319
'When the Hindustan had finished,

576

Go!

580
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:26,000
Less smoke.

'It may only have a 600cc
two-cylinder engine,

'but that didn't stop it
from putting on a good show.'

583
00:35:35,720 --> 00:35:39,479
1.14.7. Oh, that's our first
blistering time of the day.

584
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:42,599
That is a quick car.
It's blindingly quick.

585
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:44,920
You know what's going to happen?

586
00:35:44,921 --> 00:35:47,239
He'll think, "I'll go up that
hill again next weekend."

587
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:52,359
"I wonder if I can go a bit faster?
If I get that British fuel pipe hose..."

588
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:56,679
"I could improve..." And somebody in
Britain who makes hoses... Gets a sale.

589
00:35:56,680 --> 00:35:58,439
Gets a sale.

It's going backwards.

It's going, it's going,
it's going, it's going.

That's better.
I've got cancer now(!)

595
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,599
You know the Reliant Robin
is not a stable vehicle,

596
00:36:25,600 --> 00:36:28,040
as I have proved many times?
THAT makes the

597
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:30,480
Reliant Robin look like
a railway locomotive.

Good luck. 'ln fact, our hill climb
was so popular... '

out of control.'

'Eventually, the police arrived,
but only so they could have a go.'

607
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:18,079
It's a heck of a grid.
I would watch this on TV. I would.

608
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:19,320
More than Formula One.

609

'With the leaderboard almost full,
it was now our turn to set a time,

We need to demonstrate that our cars
are good. Yes. They're British.

(WHISPERING) We don't want...
Well, a little bit.

613
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:39,559
A little bit of winning.
No, no. No winning at all.

614
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,279
WHISPERING INDISTINCT
We really can't.

615
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,340
A small win?
We're hosting the event.

616
00:37:44,341 --> 00:37:46,399
You'd have to present
the prize to yourself!

617
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:50,839
'Having made Jeremy promise he
wouldn't win, I lined up the Mini.'

618

Three, two, one!

00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,839
TYRES SCREECH

620
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,000
And we're off.
This is what the Mini was born to do.

621
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,359
This thing won the Monte Carlo Rally

622
00:38:02,360 --> 00:38:04,580
and watching one of these
in classic touring

623
00:38:04,581 --> 00:38:06,800
car racing was utterly,
utterly brilliant.

624
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:11,399
Every major racing driver
of the period had one.

625
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:13,720
Enzo Ferrari had THREE
of these things!

626
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,199
HE LAUGHS

627
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:18,520
I am upholding a legend here.

628
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:24,759
Finish line in sight.
Oh, I can't go too... I mustn't win.

629
00:38:24,760 --> 00:38:29,119
Nobody can see. I'm going to give
myself a ten-second penalty, because...

630
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:32,759
I don't want to... You know, I...

631
00:38:32,760 --> 00:38:35,239
Yeah, that'll do.

632
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,279
And across the line!

633
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,239
'Hammond's diplomacy
worked brilliantly.'

634
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,519
'And now it was my turn.'

635
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:43,839
Begin.

636
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:47,079
Still going by, still going by.
Still going by. Oh, it's gone.

637
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:50,079
A Rolls-Royce, of course,
has no real motor-sport heritage,

638
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:52,560
apart from a rally the Shadow
entered in the '60s.

639
00:38:52,561 --> 00:38:56,039
Didn't do very well
and that commends it to me.

640
00:38:56,040 --> 00:39:00,599
HE MAKES CREAKING NOISES
Big old lead. This is James.

641
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:03,040
Yeah. The grill will just...

642
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:10,039
Remember, a Rolls-Royce is designed
to stop you driving like a hooligan.

643
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,080
It sort of says,
"Are you sure, sir?"

644
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:16,240
Mid-race check. Everything's good.
BUZZER SOUNDS

645
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:21,959
We're both suffering with gut sweat.
Yeah. It's interesting here,

646
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,559
you don't need your penis.

647
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:27,599
You drink and drink and drink and it
just comes out of everywhere else.

648
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:29,480
This is not needed.
Thank you, Dr

649
00:39:29,481 --> 00:39:31,360
Clarkson, that's an
interesting theory(!)

650
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:34,120
Here we are at the finish.

651
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:41,679
'James, too, posted
a thoughtful and considerate time.'

652
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,199
'Now, we could only hope
the orang-utan would do the same.'

653
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,519
Jeremy. What? You're starting off
halfway across the line.

654
00:39:49,520 --> 00:39:53,959
It's for fun! Why are you wearing
a helmet? I don't know. My helmet?

655
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:57,439
Because it wedges my head in,
so I don't roll about.

656
00:39:57,440 --> 00:39:59,479
What's that on the dash? Stopwatch.

657
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:02,519
Why? We've got a stopwatch.
No, I want to see what I'm doing.

658
00:40:02,520 --> 00:40:06,519
In three, two, one... go.

659
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,119
TYRES SCREECH
Yes, here we go!

660
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:11,999
The Jag, of course,
has a fine motor-sport pedigree.

661
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:16,759
And you can feel that pedigree
as I unleash it through the esses.

662
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:21,599
He wants to finish about 1:16.

663
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:25,759
Between the Mini and the Rolls,
because that what you'd expect.

664
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,519
Kiss the apex!
Power it out of there.

665
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,319
Up the hill.

666
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:34,839
The only problem I've got, really,
is the gear box won't kick down.

667
00:40:34,840 --> 00:40:37,640
That's because it's a ZF
box, made by Germans.

668
00:40:37,641 --> 00:40:40,439
And I'm just telling
you, if you're Indian,

669
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:43,320
"German" is a byword
for shoddy quality.

670
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:47,160
He'll stop.
He'll take a break before the top.

671
00:40:47,161 --> 00:40:49,480
I told him to pause and then...

672
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,680
And there's the finishing line.
Power!

673
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:57,039
And so, in third place,

674
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,599
the Maruti jeep driven by Nitish.
Where are you? Well done. Well done.

675
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,799
And, in second place,
the Tata Nano, driven by Sorab.

676
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:07,159
Well done, well done.
Good man, well done.

677
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:09,840
So, the winner of the
inaugural Top Gear

678
00:41:09,841 --> 00:41:12,519
All-India British
Hill-speed Climb Event...

679
00:41:12,520 --> 00:41:15,919
is the Jaguar XJS driven by Jeremy...
HE TAILS OFF

680
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:19,200
Yes! There you go.
Thank you very much. So...

681
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:23,879
Oh, God...people of India.

682
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:28,640
'Thanks to Jeremy, the hill climb
had not been a diplomatic success.'

683
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:35,199
'But then, Jaipur itself gave us
an idea for making amends.'

684
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:39,719
'In 1876, the whole city was painted
pink to celebrate a visit

685
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:43,999
'by the then Prince of Wales.'
So we thought we'd reciprocate

686
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,560
'by splitting up and decorating
our cars to celebrate India.'

687
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,359
Right. I'm going to focus my efforts
on here.

688
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:55,559
What I'm going to go for is a flag.

689
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:58,159
I already have a Union Jack
on the roof.

690
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,439
If I put Indian flag on the bonnet,

691
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:05,039
it's kind of the two brought together
on one iconic symbol of Britishness.

692
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,160
It's like a hands across the ocean,
but it's hands across the windscreen.

693
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:16,160
That is good, that is good.
Nice. Look at that.

694
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:18,680
Yee ha!

695
00:42:19,720 --> 00:42:21,679
It's good? Good?

696
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,040
You like a flock wallpaper?
BOYS: Yes, yes.

697
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,940
There's a design in the
middle which is...

698
00:42:29,941 --> 00:42:32,160
Oh, it'll be something
like an eagley thing.

699
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:39,159
Eventually, I was done,
so I went to join Jeremy.

700
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,200
DRUMS PLAY

701
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,919
Loving your shirt.
Loving your boob tube.

702
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:53,439
It's a crop top is what it is,
and this is...?

703
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,319
That's for Anglo-Indian relations.

704
00:42:55,320 --> 00:42:59,839
That's the British flag. Yeah, and
the...? That is the Indian flag.

705
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,720
But the whole car is Ganesh themed.

706
00:43:01,721 --> 00:43:04,639
Ganesh being this elephant god?
Yes.

707
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:07,079
They have an expression,
"We're doing a Ganesh",

708
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:09,400
meaning making sure something
starts auspiciously.

709
00:43:09,401 --> 00:43:11,719
I've got more elephant
themes inside.

710
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,479
Have you gone mental? No.

711
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,800
Oh, I'll just light my joss stick.
Get a smell of this.

712
00:43:18,280 --> 00:43:21,479
Now, you see, that's weed!
No, it's not!

713
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:23,079
THEY LAUGH

714
00:43:23,080 --> 00:43:26,599
Well, I have to say...
No, credit where credit's due.

715
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:28,839
YOU don't deserve any.

716
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:31,799
But wait until you see
what I've done to the Jag.

717
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:35,319
First of all, the flock effect
racing stripe. Like that.

718
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:37,759
But this is genius.

719
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:41,719
At some point on this trip, Hammond's
Bombay doors are going to break.

720
00:43:41,720 --> 00:43:44,439
We'll be stuck
in the middle of nowhere

721
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:47,840
and he is going to beg me
for use of this.

722
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:53,919
What I've done in there... Well,
I... No, it's like an ice bucket.

723
00:43:53,920 --> 00:43:55,800
You fill it up with chemicals.

724
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:01,639
This is the best thing I've ever
seen fitted to a car in India.

725
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:05,199
Everybody who comes here
gets the trots.

726
00:44:05,200 --> 00:44:06,680
Yeah. And you've got...

727
00:44:08,440 --> 00:44:12,919
No, it's very good. The thinking is
terrific. I've also tuned my badge

728
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,639
to match the temperatures
I'm experiencing in the car.

729
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,599
It's an Aga. I've taken the "J",
the "U" and the "R" out

730
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:21,039
and we're left with "Aga",
which is what it is.

731
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:23,999
'At that moment,
Rolf Harris arrived.'

732
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,840
What have you been doing?

733
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:31,519
Craftsmanship takes time.
Indian flag, Union Jack.

734
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,060
You see? It's a symbol
of British craftsmanship

735
00:44:34,061 --> 00:44:36,599
and ingenuity brought together.
It's all there.

736
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:41,359
I'm pretty certain
that's not an Indian flag. It is.

737
00:44:41,360 --> 00:44:43,560
There's a green, a white
and a red-orange stripe.

738
00:44:43,561 --> 00:44:45,759
I didn't do the
red-orange because...

739
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:49,719
I think that's in Indian one
and the stripes go HORIZONTAL.

740
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,399
You'd recognise a Union Jack
if it was that way. HORIZONTAL.

741
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:56,559
You're looking at it from this side.
Hold on a minute.

742
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:59,239
You've got one there.
It's a grapefruit in the middle.

743
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:04,319
It's segmented. Would you agree
that what he's done is that flag?

744
00:45:04,320 --> 00:45:09,640
Yes, near enough. Would you like to
know what country that is the flag of?

745
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,560
THEY LAUGH

746
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:19,119
Of all the countries YOU in
particular could have selected,

747
00:45:19,120 --> 00:45:22,759
what you've done, Richard Hammond,
is paint on your Mini

748
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:26,039
the flag of Mexico.

749
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:28,560
God, I haven't, have I? You have.

750
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:34,319
Maybe you should put a piece
of lemon in the fuel filler neck,

751
00:45:34,320 --> 00:45:37,920
see if it makes it go better.
THEY CONTINUE TO LAUGH

752
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:43,159
It was now time to head north
to Delhi,

753
00:45:43,160 --> 00:45:46,719
to host our important
ambassadorial trade reception.

754
00:45:46,720 --> 00:45:52,439
However, at that moment, James had
something more pressing on his mind.

755
00:45:52,440 --> 00:45:56,799
Hang on a minute. Hang on a minute.
It's very hot in here and you two,

756
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,919
I left you two with my car yesterday
when I was in the tuk tuk.

757
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:04,559
Oh, dear. You've interfered
with my air conditioning.

758
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,479
It's coming out red hot.
'You took it off the train!

759
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,759
'How can we mess with something that
you told us was already broken?'

760
00:46:11,760 --> 00:46:14,639
Yes, but it WAS working
and now it isn't.

761
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:16,999
Ha! 'You've been fiddling with it.'

762
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,119
So you're now saying it WAS working
and now it isn't working?

763
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,679
Yes, I was lying about it not
working. It works perfectly well,

764
00:46:24,680 --> 00:46:27,919
I was just keen for you two
not to start messing around with it.

765
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:29,639
'Have you messed around with it?'

766
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:32,839
Well, in the spirit
of new-found honesty, yes,

767
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:35,439
we ruined your air conditioning.

768
00:46:35,440 --> 00:46:38,079
Well, what was the bloody point
of that, you idiot?!

769
00:46:38,080 --> 00:46:40,120
Gandhi made us do it.

770
00:46:41,400 --> 00:46:45,919
What a pair of morons. That's all
they can do, break something.

771
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,760
They can't make anything or mend
anything, just break stuff.

772
00:46:50,760 --> 00:46:52,640
It's the ruin of Britain.

773
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:58,839
The journey to Delhi
would give us our first taste

774
00:46:58,840 --> 00:47:00,959
of life on provincial
Indian highways.

775
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:04,600
An experience which,
we'd been told, would be terrifying.

776
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:11,799
Let me give you
some alarming statistics.

777
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:15,279
Throughout India,
there are now 74 million vehicles,

778
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,359
roughly twice what we have
in the UK.

779
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:22,079
So you'd expect the death rate
to be twice as high. It isn't.

780
00:47:22,080 --> 00:47:26,239
In Britain, around about 3,000 people
a year are killed on the roads.

781
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:30,599
Last year in India, it was 196,000.

782
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:32,920
That's 22 an hour.

783
00:47:36,320 --> 00:47:40,319
This country has the most dangerous
roads in the world.

784
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:41,840
And they get worse at night.

785
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:44,999
This was a problem for us,

786
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:49,759
because as night fell, our overnight
hold was still 80 miles away.

787
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:55,280
And we were on the most dangerous
kind of road... a dual carriageway.

788
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:01,319
HORNS BLARE

789
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:05,240
Jesus Christ, that car's going
on the wrong side of the road.

790
00:48:07,040 --> 00:48:09,160
Unlit tractor up ahead, chaps.

791
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:15,599
That's completely unlit.

792
00:48:15,600 --> 00:48:19,160
An unlit wide-load in the dark
on an unlit road.

793
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:24,800
Oh, a man on the road. God!

794
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:29,120
Oh, this is tight. Oh.

795
00:48:30,760 --> 00:48:32,159
Oh.

796
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:33,480
Oh, that was scary.

797
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:37,359
Bloody hell!
HORN BLARE

798
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:40,639
You know in England, when a child
is badly behaved, the mother says

799
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:43,559
"Your father will be very cross
with you when he gets home"?

800
00:48:43,560 --> 00:48:46,999
Here, it's different. It's, "Your
father will be very cross with you"

801
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,200
"IF he gets home."

802
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,920
Oh, God. Oh, God!

803
00:48:56,560 --> 00:48:57,760
Jesus, look at that.

804
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:02,840
I mean, Ganesh, look at that.

805
00:49:04,840 --> 00:49:08,120
Blinded. Yep, can't see a thing.

806
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,879
That lorry's very close.

807
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:14,679
TYRES SCREECH

808
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:17,199
BLEEP

809
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,760
"Road narrows
for no obvious reason."

810
00:49:21,080 --> 00:49:22,920
Oh, strewth!

811
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,119
Two nerve-jangling hours later,

812
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:30,839
we arrived at the town
where we'd be staying the night.

813
00:49:30,840 --> 00:49:33,400
And as we refuelled,
I took my revenge.

814
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,999
Funny. Very funny.

815
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:51,039
Er, what James has done
is turned my heater up to full,

816
00:49:51,040 --> 00:49:56,759
and then removed the heater knob
so I can't turn it back down again.

817
00:49:56,760 --> 00:50:00,080
What a monumental bell-end he is.

818
00:50:04,760 --> 00:50:08,520
The next morning, the dual
carriageway madness continued.

819
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:13,280
Only now, we could actually see
what was going to kill us.

820
00:50:15,600 --> 00:50:17,160
Oh, God, now look.

821
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:20,640
Holy moly.

822
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,919
The man here just got out of his
lorry in the middle of the road.

823
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:28,680
Whoa!

824
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,440
HORNS BLARE
Oh!

825
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:37,599
I wonder how much else
we missed last night.

826
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:40,440
What else was going on
that we never saw?

827
00:50:43,320 --> 00:50:47,039
So the Allegro survived the night
by the looks of things

828
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:50,919
and is still with us, with a very
miserable-looking producer at the helm.

829
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,279
Serves him right for having no faith

830
00:50:53,280 --> 00:50:56,359
in these magnificent British cars
that we've chosen.

831
00:50:56,360 --> 00:51:00,919
James, is your car giving
the slightest indication

832
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:03,239
it might go wrong?

833
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,719
No. Situation update.
HE HONKS HORN

834
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,519
Oil level
and coolant temperature good.

835
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:11,879
Everything working.
Engine is as sweet as a nut.

836
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:14,120
My karma is very good.

837
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,039
'And at the next fuel stop,
his karma got even better,

838
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:23,440
'as he turned his special
revenge gun on Hammond.'

839
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:36,599
James...
The seat is stuck forwards, James.

840
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:39,279
Have you missed
with the seat in my car?

841
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:40,520
Might have done.

842
00:51:42,040 --> 00:51:45,159
Where have you put my knob?
I've forgotten.

843
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:47,119
It's so hot in there. Look.

844
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:50,920
My tablecloth has leaked dye
into my shirt.

845
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,439
'Several hours later,
we arrived in Delhi,

846
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:00,079
'where I decided
to have an accident.'

847
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,839
O... K!

848
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:06,239
'Sadly, there was no time
to worry about this small crash,

849
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:09,800
'because that night, we were hosting
our trade reception.'

850
00:52:11,080 --> 00:52:14,359
It's very obvious that this is
the right place for our party.

851
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:19,160
Lots of rich, influential people
behind these high walls and hedges.

852
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:21,600
We will do well here.

853
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:29,559
After a quick freshen up, we arrived
at the location for our party...

854
00:52:29,560 --> 00:52:33,439
an exclusive house
in the select embassy district.

855
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:37,240
Brilliant, look at this. It's good,
isn't it? This is fantastic.

856
00:52:38,320 --> 00:52:41,719
Our guests would be arriving
in just a few hours,

857
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:44,039
so James started to build
the catering tent,

858
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:49,279
I washed the cars and Hammond took
charge of decorating the marquee.

859
00:52:49,280 --> 00:52:50,399
Gather round.

860
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,279
What we need to do is make this
the colours of the Union Jack,

861
00:52:53,280 --> 00:52:56,759
British flag, so I brought some
red, white and blue cloth with me

862
00:52:56,760 --> 00:52:58,799
so we can decorate it.

863
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,639
So to your posts for now
and I'll work out a plan.

864
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,680
If you each go
and stand with one of these. Yes.

865
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:11,480
Anybody speak English?

866
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,439
Good.

867
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,840
ENGINE REVS

868
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,719
I'm getting them
in a fan shape, James.

869
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:28,559
No, that's OK, like that, yeah.
Keep going.

870
00:53:28,560 --> 00:53:30,000
OK.

871
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:37,959
We'll have do untie it
and start again.

872
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:42,000
This setback meant James would have
to start his cooking al fresco.

873
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:46,039
Tonight's dish
is a signature British dish,

874
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:49,879
but celebrates our relationship with
India, particularly our love of spices.

875
00:53:49,880 --> 00:53:53,079
It is, obviously,
coronation chicken.

876
00:53:53,080 --> 00:53:55,559
And the ingredients
are chicken and coronation.

877
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:59,759
To make the coronation, you start
with a bowl and some salad cream.

878
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,479
So you've got salad cream chicken,
basically? And spices.

879
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:06,879
Why have you got digestive biscuits?
It's going to be served on them.

880
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:10,039
That's the stupidest idea...
Why don't you go and wash the cars?

881
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,879
I've washed them. You haven't.

882
00:54:11,880 --> 00:54:15,479
I can see that it's still dirty and
still says "penis" on the bonnet.

883
00:54:15,480 --> 00:54:18,159
I squirted them with water.
That's not good enough.

884
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:20,999
We're using Madras curry powder
from the Midlands.

885
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:22,719
Sprinkle that on...

886
00:54:22,720 --> 00:54:25,439
Salad cream and curry powder
is what it is? Pretty much.

887
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:26,640
It's got sultanas...

888
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,879
Go and wash the cars.
Go and wash the cars.

889
00:54:30,880 --> 00:54:34,000
Now they're having a water fight.
Gentlemen!

890
00:54:36,080 --> 00:54:39,839
Once James had finished his recipe...
Coronation chicken, madam?

891
00:54:39,840 --> 00:54:45,599
He went into town to buy fireworks,
leaving me alone with the orang-utan.

892
00:54:45,600 --> 00:54:48,959
This is magnificently brilliant.

893
00:54:48,960 --> 00:54:53,799
I think the guests are going
to just adore having a go in this.

894
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,640
A bit of tweed action going on.
THUD

895
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,680
Oh, no!

896
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,279
Oh, my God.

897
00:55:04,280 --> 00:55:08,719
'Between us, we worked out
that James was going to notice.'

898
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:10,919
Have you got any green paint? No.

899
00:55:10,920 --> 00:55:14,840
Yes. Yes! You have? We've brought
a load of Airfix models. Have we?

900
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:20,000
Spitfire green. Yes, here we go.
We can have this fixed.

901
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:26,440
I don't think he's got enough
of his instruments painted over.

902
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:30,999
JEREMY LAUGHS

903
00:55:31,000 --> 00:55:32,760
That's much better.

904
00:55:34,360 --> 00:55:36,919
A bit later on,
James returned with his fireworks,

905
00:55:36,920 --> 00:55:39,640
which, frankly,
were not what I'd had in mind.

906
00:55:41,000 --> 00:55:44,159
James, I know you live in 1956,
but the world has moved on,

907
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,199
these are pathetic. They'll be good.

908
00:55:46,200 --> 00:55:49,159
These are big as well.
They're rubbish.

909
00:55:49,160 --> 00:55:51,719
There's a limit to the size
of fireworks you can have

910
00:55:51,720 --> 00:55:55,479
in, let's be honest, the middle of the
Government area, lots of embassies,

911
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:58,439
on a high state of alert
because of the threat of terrorism.

912
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,839
You can't let off
a millennium fireworks...

913
00:56:00,840 --> 00:56:02,599
it's a garden fireworks display.

914
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:05,919
That's going to be like lighting
a match. No, it isn't. It is.

915
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:09,559
'I decided to take matters in hand.'

916
00:56:09,560 --> 00:56:14,199
OK, what you need to make
a really big firework is, er...

917
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:18,399
a length of drainpipe,
a cane, teaspoon, Sellotape,

918
00:56:18,400 --> 00:56:22,039
sharp knife, saucer
and a pair of pixellated hands,

919
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:25,479
so you at home
can't see what I'm doing.

920
00:56:25,480 --> 00:56:27,999
Right, you take, well, any firework.

921
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:31,519
Let's start
with this relatively small one.

922
00:56:31,520 --> 00:56:33,839
And you apply the sharp knife.

923
00:56:33,840 --> 00:56:36,719
Now, being very careful
not to hit the...

924
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:38,640
Let's not give that a name.

925
00:56:40,200 --> 00:56:42,959
Our plan was to show
our top business guests

926
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,199
some of Britain's finest products,

927
00:56:45,200 --> 00:56:48,559
with each of us championing
one particular thing.

928
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,400
James selected a superb lawnmower.

929
00:56:53,240 --> 00:56:54,999
Oh, that is...

930
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:58,559
And as it winds itself up, it gets
further in, that's brilliant.

931
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,279
You know what, that is actually...
It's all right, isn't it?

932
00:57:02,280 --> 00:57:03,520
That's a good display.

933
00:57:03,521 --> 00:57:07,439
'I would be promoting something
very close to my heart... '

934
00:57:07,440 --> 00:57:08,759
Hair products.

935
00:57:08,760 --> 00:57:11,799
It's a little-known fact
that we in Britain

936
00:57:11,800 --> 00:57:15,439
are extensive producers
of a huge range of hair product.

937
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,039
Nicky Clarke, she's a well-known
hairdresser, I think.

938
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:22,119
What I'm going to do is arrange
a display, but more than that...

939
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:25,919
in keeping with the theme, which is
kind of active, actually doing stuff,

940
00:57:25,920 --> 00:57:28,879
I'm going to style myself
and turn myself into a walking,

941
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:30,319
moving billboard.

942
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:33,359
You need to be able to remove,

943
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:38,599
from in here, all of the stuff that
looks a bit like it could belong

944
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,880
in a fondue set,
but isn't really the same.

945
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,719
By the time James had got
his lawnmower under control,

946
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,359
Jeremy had completed
his cruise missile.

947
00:58:07,360 --> 00:58:08,639
Here we are.

948
00:58:08,640 --> 00:58:10,879
The finished product.

949
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:15,639
My giant firework, with stick,
with prong on the end,

950
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:17,320
ready to be launched.

951
00:58:18,440 --> 00:58:21,759
With that done, I was free to break
out the product I'd be promoting,

952
00:58:21,760 --> 00:58:25,799
the Corby trouser press,
which I believed could perform

953
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,919
a vital extra service
for the Indian customer.

954
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,319
The Corby naan-press.
There it is.

955
00:58:32,320 --> 00:58:34,000
Is it hot? Ooh, ah!

956
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:39,600
Mmm. That is good. Mm.

957
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:42,919
With the preparations complete,

958
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:47,720
it was time to smarten ourselves up
and greet our VIP guests.

959
00:58:49,240 --> 00:58:53,920
How'd you do? Barley water, Tizer,
English wine, coronation chicken.

960
00:58:55,080 --> 00:58:58,519
You do the wine, I'll go around
with coronation chicken.

961
00:58:58,520 --> 00:59:02,719
'Meanwhile, Richard was in charge
of valet parking.'

962
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:03,800
Hello, welcome.

963
00:59:03,801 --> 00:59:06,959
Right, thank you. I'm going
to put this somewhere prominent.

964
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,400
I love the paint, by the way.

965
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:13,400
Keys. Er... Oh, hello, that'll do.

966
00:59:17,480 --> 00:59:20,959
It's powdered and you simply add
water and you get mashed potato.

967
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:25,359
I think it's better
than the real thing. Lovely.

968
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:28,599
Forgive me for interrupting,
I brought your vegetarian option.

969
00:59:28,600 --> 00:59:31,879
This is a sweet one... Angel Delight
on a Digestive biscuit.

970
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,560
Hello. Hello, how are you?
I'm very well, thank you.

971
00:59:35,440 --> 00:59:40,359
This is gentleman's relish on
a water biscuit and this is Marmite.

972
00:59:40,360 --> 00:59:41,800
Right.

973
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:55,239
'As darkness fell,
the guests continued to arrive.'

974
00:59:55,240 --> 00:59:57,959
If you'd like to park up there,
I'll do the proper park.

975
00:59:57,960 --> 01:00:01,239
Yours is a temporary park.
I'm doing the big, actual park.

976
01:00:01,240 --> 01:00:03,879
It's my job.
Move up, if you would, sir.

977
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,879
'With the party in full swing,

978
01:00:06,880 --> 01:00:09,559
'it was time to demonstrate
our British products.

And Jeremy's diplomacy was as bad
as it had been at the hill-climb.

982
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:23,439
This is something I think
you could sell well in India.

983
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:27,080
Most British two or three-star
hotels have these.

984
01:00:28,360 --> 01:00:31,039
Judging by the cars
that were turning up,

985
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:33,639
it was clear Delhi's elite
had come to the party.

986
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,839
But unfortunately for Richard,
they'd all arrived at once.

987
01:00:37,840 --> 01:00:42,199
I'm your valet park... Oh, just wait
there, I'm going to park your car.

988
01:00:42,200 --> 01:00:43,320
Just don't move.

989
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,679
Hold on. Nobody park.
No, where are they going? Agh!

990
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,479
I have a proper
British lawnmower at home,

991
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:54,239
an Atco twin-clutch,
but I don't actually have a lawn,

992
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:57,679
but it's still something that's very
pleasant to own, as an artefact,

993
01:00:57,680 --> 01:01:00,919
as an example of fine engineering,
with a great engineering...

994
01:01:00,920 --> 01:01:05,239
'So, James was boring everyone
to death,

'my parking system
was in disarray... '

997
01:01:10,480 --> 01:01:13,839
Just one second. I just... Don't go.

998
01:01:13,840 --> 01:01:16,999
'..and Jeremy was still being
a diplomatic nightmare.'

999
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,359
I could arrive at your house,
do my business,

1000
01:01:19,360 --> 01:01:23,080
and then come and see you without
doing it all over your kitchen floor.

1001

ALARM SOUNDS

1018
01:02:10,720 --> 01:02:16,079
Strangely, the guests took this
massive explosion as a cue to leave,

1019
01:02:16,080 --> 01:02:18,360
but that was harder
than they thought.

1020
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:25,320
This one? It's not that one.

1021
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,959
The next morning,
we had to face the fact

1022
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,519
that our party had been a disaster.

1023
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,599
But it had been even worse than that
for Hammond.

1024
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:42,479
Just tell me what happened.
A very tall, willowy Indian girl

1025
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:46,239
wanted her photograph taken with me,
so she stood next to me.

1026
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:49,559
Yeah, yeah? And just as a man was
about to take the picture on a phone,

1027
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:52,159
a small creature,
an insect... a fly, perhaps...

1028
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,719
bit sharply into my right teste.

1029
01:02:54,720 --> 01:02:57,399
Through your trousers?
I imagine it went up the leg.

1030
01:02:57,400 --> 01:03:00,759
Well, it's not a long journey.
That's a long way, this is...

1031
01:03:00,760 --> 01:03:02,678
Crawled all the way up
to bite you...

1032
01:03:02,679 --> 01:03:05,160
It chose that moment...
"Yes, of course... agh!"

1033
01:03:05,161 --> 01:03:07,679
I couldn't...
That's flat out. Look at it.

1034
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:09,319
So it's...

1035
01:03:09,320 --> 01:03:12,399
So he's got
an out-of-control lawnmower,

1036
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,879
you have... A sore plum.
..a sore plum.

1037
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:18,799
I think it's now time
to leave the city, to leave Delhi,

1038
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,880
and get on
with our countryside mission.

1039
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:26,239
We decided to head even further
north, into the Himalayas,

1040
01:03:26,240 --> 01:03:30,559
where our cars would be faced with
rough roads and mountainous terrain.

1041
01:03:30,560 --> 01:03:34,839
So, to prepare them for this,
we found a workshop...

1042
01:03:34,840 --> 01:03:37,639
and cue the music.

1043
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:41,080
MUSIC: Theme from "The A-Team"

1044
01:03:53,560 --> 01:03:55,400
That's what I'm talking about.

1045
01:04:10,080 --> 01:04:12,640
LOUD RASPING HUM

1046
01:04:14,280 --> 01:04:16,999
OK, what I've done to the Jag is...

1047
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:19,399
is ruin it comprehensively.

1048
01:04:19,400 --> 01:04:21,920
'I'd fitted much chunkier
tyres, which had

1049
01:04:21,921 --> 01:04:24,439
meant messing around
with the suspension,

1050
01:04:24,440 --> 01:04:27,199
'and this had had
a dramatic effect.'

1051
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,319
The ride is now intolerable,

1052
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:33,599
the tyres are catching
on the arches, as you can hear.

1053
01:04:33,600 --> 01:04:36,079
The noise is simply unbearable,

1054
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:39,759
the braking is now very poor,
the rev counter has broken,

1055
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:41,799
BUT on the upside, though,

1056
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:44,599
because the exhaust now
goes straight out of the bonnet

1057
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:48,399
rather than under the car,
I have much more ground clearance,

1058
01:04:48,400 --> 01:04:49,880
about that much more.

1059
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:54,400
HUMMING
Oh! Ho, ho, ho!

1060
01:04:55,880 --> 01:04:59,519
James had also fiddled
with his suspension

1061
01:04:59,520 --> 01:05:01,519
to accommodate the chunkier rubber.

1062
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:03,640
And he too had made
a complete mess of it.

1063
01:05:05,440 --> 01:05:07,240
Oh, God!

1064
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:11,519
I've ruined everything.

1065
01:05:11,520 --> 01:05:15,160
There's no point trying to say anything
intelligent, it's just too noisy.

1066
01:05:22,160 --> 01:05:24,480
That is quite a noise, isn't it?
HE LAUGHS

1067
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:28,079
My car is fine,

1068
01:05:28,080 --> 01:05:32,519
because I haven't modified
or messed about with it.

1069
01:05:32,520 --> 01:05:35,599
I put it on some new tyres...
that's not modification,

1070
01:05:35,600 --> 01:05:39,359
that's something you do. I put it
on rally tyres, just in case.

1071
01:05:39,360 --> 01:05:42,719
I have fitted a sump guard to protect
the underside if it bottoms out,

1072
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:44,439
and the winch... that's not for me,

1073
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,279
that's to rescue those two idiots
WHEN they get stuck,

1074
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:48,800
which they will. That's it.

1075
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:56,080
The overnight hold
is 198 miles away.

1076
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,600

arguing about whose car was worse.'

'..we decided to swap.'

1083
01:06:21,080 --> 01:06:23,359
What a shocking racket!

1084
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,920
LOUD THUMPING AND HUMMING

1085
01:06:31,760 --> 01:06:33,080

There is smoke, isn't there,
coming from the Rolls?

1089
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:45,199
No, it's coming off the tyre.

1090
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:48,039
Oh, James,
you can have this back now.

1091
01:06:48,040 --> 01:06:49,680
It's frightening.

1092
01:06:50,960 --> 01:06:52,679
I'm really sorry, Mr Cameron.

our trade mission is in tatters.

1094
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:01,439
Back in the Jag, I decided
to use my new PA system

1095
01:07:01,440 --> 01:07:05,479

HE wouldn't enjoy.

01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:33,799
Your lawn, grown too long.

1144
01:10:33,800 --> 01:10:36,079
Engage the lawnmower.

1145
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,879
It is simply blown away. Like that.
We'll work on that...

1146
01:10:39,880 --> 01:10:43,159
'Nobody was very interested.

1147
01:10:43,160 --> 01:10:45,719
'So, at the hotel that night,
to cheer ourselves up,

'Hammond and I decided
to improve May's Rolls.'

1149
01:10:50,360 --> 01:10:52,999
What are you doing?
Thread that through his car.

1150
01:10:53,000 --> 01:10:55,639
To the horn, in such a way...
Go and find the horn.

1151
01:10:55,640 --> 01:10:58,839
Through the back seat.
Don't knock my beer over.

1152
01:10:58,840 --> 01:11:00,840
I'm not going
to knock your beer over!

we woke up in Switzerland.

'It was also more peaceful as I had
fitted some silencers to my Jag.'

1156
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:27,639
On the upside, my new exhaust system
is much quieter than before.

1157
01:11:27,640 --> 01:11:31,639
On the downside, it's making
a really annoying, jangling sound

1158
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:33,640
and I can't see where I'm going.

1159
01:11:34,880 --> 01:11:36,799
Still, it could be worse.

1161
01:11:38,920 --> 01:11:41,439
HORN BLARES AGAIN

1162
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:43,400
Hammond? Yes!

1163
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:48,399
Can you hear a blowing noise?

1164
01:11:48,400 --> 01:11:50,319
Oh, for God's sake!

1165
01:11:50,320 --> 01:11:53,400
THEY LAUGH

1166
01:11:54,760 --> 01:11:56,639
'What's the matter?'

1167
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:58,820
Well, I suspect you
know, but I'll explain

1168
01:11:58,821 --> 01:12:01,000
it to you anyway...
braking sounds the horn.

1169
01:12:02,480 --> 01:12:05,359
HORN BLARES REPEATEDLY

1170
01:12:05,360 --> 01:12:10,679
They've given me an interesting
game now... try to avoid braking.

1171
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:12,320
HORN BLARES

1172
01:12:14,680 --> 01:12:18,159

1178
01:12:35,240 --> 01:12:36,840
Oh!

1179
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,680
'So, we kept on climbing.'

1180
01:12:43,680 --> 01:12:45,839
This is the road to China.

1181
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,959
Tibet. Can I say Tibet?

1182
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:52,719
I'm not sure what the politically
correct way of saying that is.

1183
01:12:52,720 --> 01:12:55,600
Doubtless the BBC
has some ancient way of saying it.

1184
01:12:59,280 --> 01:13:02,279
We're at 12,000 feet.

1185
01:13:02,280 --> 01:13:03,960
One hell of a drop on the right.

1186
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:10,560
It's OK because there's a big row
of pebbles to stop me going over.

1187
01:13:14,680 --> 01:13:19,120
On the plus side, though, at this
height, the views were staggering.

1188
01:13:20,880 --> 01:13:22,319
Oh, oh!

1189
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,920
This is... something else.

1190
01:13:28,680 --> 01:13:31,039
That stays with you for ever.

1191
01:13:31,040 --> 01:13:33,320
Utterly beautiful.

1192
01:13:34,800 --> 01:13:37,799
I know just the song
that will match the moment.

1193
01:13:37,800 --> 01:13:39,759
No, it won't.

surroundings was all well and good,

1198
01:13:56,240 --> 01:14:00,799
This has a last frontier feel
to it, this does. I hope it isn't.

1199
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:04,519
Not much call for trouser presses
or lawnmowers here,

1200

his Mini, would hear none of it.'

I'll just keep going
until Everest comes into view

1205
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,760

Oh, that's bouncing.

1207
01:14:36,120 --> 01:14:38,520
It hops from bump to bump!
HE GIGGLES

1208
01:14:48,960 --> 01:14:52,759
This is actually quite unpleasant.

1209
01:14:52,760 --> 01:14:54,679
But we must soldier on...

1210
01:14:54,680 --> 01:14:56,400
for our country.

1211
01:15:00,160 --> 01:15:02,519
The problem is that mud
and rock slides

1212
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:04,879
take this road away
every few months.

1213
01:15:04,880 --> 01:15:12,039
Look, just a massive rock slide
there has ruined the road.

'Finally,
it was George Harrison's go.'

Oh, no! So close!

1231
01:16:37,680 --> 01:16:40,320
It looked very good for a moment.
It DID look very good.

1232
01:16:41,880 --> 01:16:44,159
How much does that weigh, James?

1233
01:16:44,160 --> 01:16:46,519
2.2 tonnes.

1234
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:48,599
2.2 tonnes of Rolls-Royce.

1235
01:16:48,600 --> 01:16:51,119
Off-roading.

1236
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:54,879
Now, rock it out.

situations like this.

Yeah, I'll give it the beans.

1253
01:17:42,840 --> 01:17:46,479
Right! Jeremy, give it 1,500 rpm.

Yes!

Let's get it moved! Here we go now!

1258
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:03,559
Say when. I'm winching it in, taking
it up now, you should feel the pull.

I don't understand winching, but
I don't think that is part of it.

1264
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,319
It's not moving at all!

1265
01:18:27,320 --> 01:18:29,959
Oh, hang on a minute. What?

1266
01:18:29,960 --> 01:18:31,920
No, just give it some more revs!
No, stop!

Hello.

1271
01:19:03,960 --> 01:19:06,840
Can you think of any way
that we can cheer Hammond up?

1272
01:19:08,040 --> 01:19:10,599
Well, Genesis springs to mind.

1273
01:19:10,600 --> 01:19:12,959

In fact, it was quite a while

01:19:43,680 --> 01:19:47,479
Guys, how far away is the hotel?
How many hours?

1281
01:19:47,480 --> 01:19:50,159
'Er... about two hours.'

'What suggestion?'

1291
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,399

01:20:39,720 --> 01:20:41,160
Sorry.

we go from Monaco to Portofino?!

1306

How luxurious can this be?!

1307
01:21:08,280 --> 01:21:10,300
I was the first to check
in to a five-star hotel.

1308
01:21:10,301 --> 01:21:12,319
As you can see, I've
done it properly.

1309
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:16,159
A man's carrying all my bags. Yes.
But then Jeremy arrived. Yes.

1310
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:18,799
Diddly dee, dee, diddly dee!
"Oh, my word, Jeremy,"

1311
01:21:18,800 --> 01:21:20,760
"look what you've got as your car?!"

1312
01:21:20,761 --> 01:21:22,679
"It's the new Ferrari FF."

1313
01:21:22,680 --> 01:21:25,759
I wonder where Hammond is?

1314
01:21:25,760 --> 01:21:30,040
Hammond had indeed checked into a
Formule 1 in a Renault 4. THEY LAUGH

1315
01:21:41,160 --> 01:21:45,119
The next morning, as I was
finishing off my Mini repairs,

1316
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,639
it was clear that Jeremy
hadn't had the best of nights.

1317
01:21:49,640 --> 01:21:54,439
My pillow was just a pillowcase
soaked in glacial water

1318
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:56,119
and then filled with stones.

1319
01:21:56,120 --> 01:21:59,679
My sleeping bag broke.
My blanket was see-through.

1320
01:21:59,680 --> 01:22:03,959
My body was down to a temperature
hitherto unknown to science.

1321
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:06,360
I would have come and bludgeoned
you to death last night.

1322
01:22:06,361 --> 01:22:08,760
But you're not moaning
about it, so that's OK(!)

1323
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,639
The misery of tenting
wasn't our only problem,

1324
01:22:19,640 --> 01:22:22,799
because we were running out of India
and it was clear,

1325
01:22:22,800 --> 01:22:24,280
looking back...

1326
01:22:26,160 --> 01:22:29,040
that our trade mission
hadn't been a success.

1327
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:34,560
Thank you very much.

1328
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:39,399
CRASHING

1329
01:22:39,400 --> 01:22:41,040
ALARM BLARES

1330
01:22:45,920 --> 01:22:49,759
But then, in the next valley,
we came across some kids playing

1331
01:22:49,760 --> 01:22:53,520
a rudimentary version
of India's most revered sport...

1332
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,079
which we decided
could be improved.

1333
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:01,639
Guys!

1334
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:04,879
Excuse me? Guys!

1335
01:23:04,880 --> 01:23:07,279
What's this?

1336
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:09,599
Right, you ready, Hammo?

1337
01:23:09,600 --> 01:23:12,160
Ready?!
HE REVS THE ENGINE

1338
01:23:14,240 --> 01:23:15,959
Ohhh!

1339
01:23:15,960 --> 01:23:17,159
Ready?!

1340
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:19,520
HE REVS THE ENGINE AGAIN

1341
01:23:22,240 --> 01:23:25,199
'And so, outside the Hillview cafe,

1342
01:23:25,200 --> 01:23:28,520
'high in the Himalayas,
straight six cricket was born.'

1343
01:23:30,160 --> 01:23:32,399
Whoa! There it comes! Oh, very good!

1344
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:34,719
THEY LAUGH

1345
01:23:34,720 --> 01:23:37,999
We burdened them
with the misery of cricket.

1346
01:23:38,000 --> 01:23:41,480
Now, we're here to reinvent it.

1347
01:23:42,520 --> 01:23:46,719
'In fact, it was such a hit,
we decided to have a Test match.'

1348
01:23:46,720 --> 01:23:48,519
This is England versus India now!

1349
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:51,800
Our crew are going to do
some fielding.

1350
01:23:55,440 --> 01:23:56,799
Good shot!

1351
01:23:56,800 --> 01:24:00,079
New bowler, everybody. James May.

1352
01:24:00,080 --> 01:24:02,000
HE REVS THE ENGINE

1353
01:24:03,080 --> 01:24:05,479
Stat! Catch it!

1354
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:07,920
CHEERING

1355
01:24:09,720 --> 01:24:13,439
Yes! Somebody's out!
Love your move!

1356
01:24:13,440 --> 01:24:15,560
Good answer!

1357
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:21,679
'Half a tank of Jag fuel later,
the match was over

1358
01:24:21,680 --> 01:24:23,959
'and India had won.'

1359
01:24:23,960 --> 01:24:26,279
You know the Ashes?

1360
01:24:26,280 --> 01:24:28,959
This is the bridge
from his double bass.

1361
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:32,839
We burn this and then
we present it in an urn...

1362
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:34,439
to you.

1363
01:24:34,440 --> 01:24:38,280
'For the first time on our trade
mission, we'd got something right.

1364
01:24:39,800 --> 01:24:43,679
'In burning a bridge,
we'd actually built a bridge

1365
01:24:43,680 --> 01:24:48,679
'that would become a business bridge
of friendship and erm... trade.'

1366
01:24:48,680 --> 01:24:50,679
Well, there, that was quite good.

1367
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:53,519
Careful. They're really hot. Hot!

1368
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:57,039
You have the Ashes. You have the
Ashes. Well done. See you in a year.

1369
01:24:57,040 --> 01:24:59,199
Well done, everybody.
Back in a year!

1370
01:24:59,200 --> 01:25:02,880
We're taking them home next year!

1371
01:25:04,040 --> 01:25:08,040
There was something else
that we got right on this trip...

1372
01:25:10,320 --> 01:25:12,480
our cars.

1373
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,280
This Jaguar has been...

1374
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:20,399
well, genuinely astonishing.

1375
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:24,399
It really has. It's done things
WAY beyond what was envisaged

1376
01:25:24,400 --> 01:25:26,239
when it was designed.

1377
01:25:26,240 --> 01:25:28,919
And really, it's been two cars...

1378
01:25:28,920 --> 01:25:30,799
in Bombay and Jaipur,

1379
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,639
it was sleek and graceful and fast,

1380
01:25:33,640 --> 01:25:36,439
whereas here in the mountains,

1381
01:25:36,440 --> 01:25:38,399
it's just plain heroic.

1382
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:40,920
I really, genuinely love this car.

1383
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:44,279
I want an XJS in my life.

1384
01:25:44,280 --> 01:25:47,719
There's just something about it
which is absolutely brilliant.

1385
01:25:47,720 --> 01:25:49,679
ENGINE REVS

1386
01:25:49,680 --> 01:25:52,920
I'm exhausted,
but the old girl isn't.

1387
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:58,079
While we're alone, viewers,
I'll be honest with you,

1388
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,399
I wasn't absolutely sure
I'd make it in a Rolls-Royce.

1389
01:26:01,400 --> 01:26:05,439
I always knew it was a gamble. And I
was nervous about it all along.

1390
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:09,000
But look at this now...
all still working perfectly.

1391
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:11,880
And it served me well.

1392
01:26:11,881 --> 01:26:13,759
It hasn't really done
anything wrong, this car,

1393
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:16,759
the only problems would have been
ones that I created.

1394
01:26:16,760 --> 01:26:19,240
It's just remarkable.

1395
01:26:25,200 --> 01:26:26,919
One tough little puppy.

1396
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:30,199
And it's torn its own face off
and been stitched back on.

1397
01:26:30,200 --> 01:26:33,119
It's bruised, battered and scarred,
but it's joyful.

1398
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:35,519
Even now, battling itself to pieces,

1399
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:37,800
it's a happy noise.

1400
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,640
It's still willing.

1401
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:51,759
'The truth is that these three
fantastic cars have been better

1402
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:55,879
'ambassadors for Britain
than we could ever be.

1403
01:26:55,880 --> 01:26:58,320
'And that gave us an idea.'

1404
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:03,400
This is the place. This is perfect.

1405
01:27:04,960 --> 01:27:06,840
Well, this is it.

1406
01:27:07,840 --> 01:27:09,359
Goodbye, Jag.

1407
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:13,760
You have been an absolute star
and I'm going to miss you.

1408
01:27:20,480 --> 01:27:24,359
The Mini, the Jag and the Rolls
would be mounted on plinths here,

1409
01:27:24,360 --> 01:27:28,600
high in the mountains by the road
connecting India and China...

1410
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:31,959
so that forevermore,

1411
01:27:31,960 --> 01:27:36,439
people travelling between these two
great economic superpowers will be

1412
01:27:36,440 --> 01:27:40,720
reminded that far away, there's
a small island called Britain...

1413
01:27:42,360 --> 01:27:44,600
Great Britain.
